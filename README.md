# GR Failure Manifold

**Mapping GR's failure manifold: 90 computational experiments stress-testing General Relativity through black holes, rotating spacetimes, exotic geometries, quantum fields, observer superposition, and holographic emergence**

This repository contains a structured collection of minimal computational "toys" designed to **locate, reproduce, and classify failure modes of classical General Relativity (GR)**. Rather than proposing new dynamics or alternatives to GR, the lab systematically probes **where and how GR loses predictive or operational meaning**.

The result is an explicit map of GR treated honestly as an **effective theory**.

---

## What this project is

- A **diagnostic test suite**, not a model or simulator
- A **boundary-mapping exercise**, not a refutation of GR
- A collection of **minimal pressure tests** that isolate specific assumptions
- A reproducible way to classify **failure triggers and failure modes**
- A systematic analysis of what the **pattern of failures** reveals about GR's nature

Each toy is intentionally simple and adversarial: it is designed to make a specific assumption of GR fail cleanly and observably.

---

## What this project is not

- ❌ Not a claim that GR is empirically false  
- ❌ Not a replacement theory  
- ❌ Not a quantum gravity proposal  
- ❌ Not a numerical relativity production code  

Nothing here contradicts the Einstein equations. Instead, the lab shows **where those equations stop being sufficient to define unique, observer-independent physics**.

## Structure of the lab

The lab consists of **90 toys**, grouped into phases that reflect increasingly global or subtle limits of the theory:

1. **Foundations & Baselines** — Schwarzschild, Newtonian, waves, FLRW
2. **Horizons & Coordinates** — Rindler, coordinate pathologies, horizon regularity
3. **Kerr & Rotation** — Rotating black holes, energy extraction, superradiance
4. **Exotic Spacetimes** — Gödel, warp drives, wormholes, consistency limits
5. **Observers & Scales** — Tidal forces, measurement limits, equivalence principle
6. **Singularities & Extensions** — Global topology, determinism breakdown
7. **Self-Force & Backreaction** — Test particle limits, radiation reaction
8. **Numerical & Formulation** — Implementation, validation, well-posedness
9. **Boundaries & Relational** — Domain effects, relational measurements
10. **Semiclassical/QFT** — Quantum fields on curved spacetime
11. **Quantum Observers** — Observer superposition, emergent causality
12. **Holography & Emergence** — AdS/CFT, theorem boundaries, EFT limits
13. **Formulation & Topology** — PDE health, cosmic strings, classical chaos

Each toy is classified along four orthogonal axes:

- **Failure Trigger**  
  (geometric, observer, energetic, matter, causal, numerical, boundary, state, global, meta, formulation)

- **Failure Mode**  
  (observer disagreement, predictability loss, energy nonconservation, invariant divergence, operational undefinedness, constraint violation, ensemble spread, observer ontology breakdown)

- **Failure Sharpness**  
  (sharp, contextual, thick)

- **Repairable Within Classical GR**  
  (yes / no / reinterpretation only)

---

## Executed results

All executed toys include **machine-readable JSON outputs** encoding observed results such as:

- Predictability loss
- Observer-dependent disagreements
- Invariant divergences
- Shock formation
- Constraint violations
- Instability thresholds
- Ensemble spread (for stochastic/state-dependent cases)
- Observer ontology breakdown (quantum superposition of observers)
- Global theorem boundary violations
- EFT breakdown
- Failure clustering

## v1.1.6: Complete Redescription + 5 New Toys

**New in this release:** 

### Complete Documentation Overhaul
All 90 toys have been **completely redescribed** with comprehensive documentation including:
- **Physical setup** — What the toy models and why
- **Stress test purpose** — What conceptual trap or limitation is exposed
- **JSON interpretation guide** — How to read the output fields
- **Mathematical context** — Key equations and scaling laws
- **Over-interpretation warnings** — What NOT to conclude

### Five New Toys (086-090)

**Phase XIII Extended** with formulation health and topological diagnostics:

1. **Toy 086 — Hyperbolicity and Well-Posedness Failure**  
   Jordan-block formulation shows how weakly hyperbolic systems become ill-posed in the high-frequency limit, even without physical instability.

2. **Toy 087 — Cosmic String: Topology Without Local Curvature**  
   Idealized cosmic string demonstrates global topological effects (deficit angle, holonomy) despite vanishing curvature invariants everywhere off-axis.

3. **Toy 088 — Classical Chaos Without Singularities**  
   Two-center gravitational potential exhibits Lyapunov instability and exponential sensitivity to initial conditions in smooth, singularity-free dynamics.

4. **Toy 089 — Birkhoff Boundary via Spherically Symmetric Radiation**  
   Outgoing Vaidya spacetime shows exactly where Birkhoff's theorem fails: when the vacuum assumption is relaxed to allow radiation.

5. **Toy 090 — Hyperbolicity via Principal Symbol**  
   Abstract PDE analysis demonstrates how eigenvalue structure of the principal symbol controls well-posedness, independent of physical content.

### Structural Changes

- **Toy descriptions**: All 90 toys completely rewritten for clarity and pedagogy
- **File organization**: Python scripts, JSON outputs, and execution logs now organized in `toys/` folder
  - `py.zip` — All Python source files
  - `json.zip` — All JSON output files  
  - `logs.zip` — All execution logs
- **Phase structure**: Refined thematic organization across 13 phases
- **Version**: Updated to v1.1.6

## Why this is useful

### For Understanding GR
- Clarifies common GR "paradoxes" as observer or coordinate artifacts
- Makes energy ambiguity explicit rather than philosophical
- Separates curvature singularities from predictability breakdown
- Exposes where test-particle and fixed-background approximations fail
- Provides a baseline against which extensions of GR can be compared

### For Theoretical Research
- Pattern analysis constrains what kind of theory GR is (fundamental vs. emergent)
- Provides testable signatures for emergent spacetime hypotheses
- Guides where to look for new physics:
  - Pre-geometric quantum information theory
  - Quantum reference frames / relational quantum mechanics
  - Emergent causality frameworks
  - Resolution of cosmological constant problem
  - Understanding of global theorem preconditions

This lab is most useful for readers who already know GR and want to understand **its limits, not just its successes**.

## How to use this repository

### As a Diagnostic Tool
- **Reference index** of GR failure modes
- **Sanity check** when claiming "GR predicts X"
- **Diagnostic harness** for numerical or theoretical work
- **Baseline** for comparing GR to semiclassical or modified theories

### As a Research Framework
- Test whether your theory resolves documented failure modes
- Compare your theory's boundary structure to GR's failure manifold
- Assess whether your theory handles quantum observers
- Check if your theory addresses causality emergence
- Verify compatibility with QFT-GR incompatibility
- Evaluate whether your theory treats global theorems as conditional
- Confirm your theory has smooth EFT breakdown, not sharp cutoff
- Verify systematic failure structure matches effective theory
- Identify experimental signatures to test emergence hypothesis

## End state

By Toy 090:

- Every major failure trigger is sampled (geometric, observer, energetic, matter, causal, numerical, boundary, state, global, meta, formulation)
- Every major failure mode is demonstrated (observer disagreement, predictability loss, energy nonconservation, invariant divergence, operational undefinedness, constraint violation, observer ontology breakdown)
- Failures range from sharp to contextual to thick
- Classical GR is mapped as an effective theory with a well-defined failure manifold
- Observers, time, and causality shown to be emergent alongside spacetime
- Even global theorems, EFT validity, and foundational assumptions shown to be conditional
- Formulation health and topological structure demonstrated as independent failure modes

**This project does not argue against General Relativity.**  
**It shows exactly where and how it stops being a theory.**

The structure of that failure manifold suggests what kind of theory it is:  
**An emergent effective description rather than a fundamental or nearly-fundamental one.**
