# Process and Tooling

This repository was created using an **AI-assisted, human-directed workflow**.

The conceptual design, objectives, and validation criteria of the project were defined and supervised by a human author. ChatGPT was used as a tool to assist with drafting, structuring, iterating, and organizing the material under continuous direction.

## Role of the human author

The human role in this project included:

- Defining the purpose of the lab (diagnosing failure modes of classical GR)
- Selecting which assumptions to probe and how to probe them
- Directing the structure of the toy index and phase organization
- Deciding what constitutes a meaningful “failure” versus a reinterpretation
- Reviewing, correcting, and approving all classifications and results
- Verifying alignment between executed outputs and documented conclusions

All conceptual decisions and final judgments were human-made.

## Role of ChatGPT

ChatGPT was used to assist with:

- Drafting and refining Markdown documentation
- Structuring the toy taxonomy and classification axes
- Normalizing language and formatting across entries
- Iteratively aligning written descriptions with executed results
- Helping surface structural inconsistencies during revision

ChatGPT did **not** autonomously define the goals of the project, select interpretations, or validate results without supervision.

## Validation and responsibility

All content in this repository was reviewed for:

- Internal consistency
- Alignment with executed outputs
- Faithful representation of what the diagnostics actually show

Responsibility for the correctness, framing, and interpretation of the work rests with the human author.

## Motivation for disclosure

This file exists to document the process transparently, not to promote or diminish the use of AI tools. The project is presented on its technical and conceptual merits, with tooling disclosed for completeness.

## Scope note

This repository does not make empirical claims, propose new physical laws, or replace existing theories. It is a diagnostic and classificatory exercise focused on the limits of applicability of classical General Relativity.
