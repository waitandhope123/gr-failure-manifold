## Toy 001 — Schwarzschild Baseline: Curvature vs Coordinate Pathologies

This toy evaluates the exact Schwarzschild vacuum spacetime in geometric units ($G=c=1$) and exports a small set of invariants and “observable-like” diagnostics as a function of radius $r$ around a mass parameter $M$. The physical setup is a static, spherically symmetric exterior geometry, with the quantity of interest being how different diagnostics behave as you approach the horizon at $r=2M$ versus the central curvature blow-up at $r\to 0$. The anchor for “true” curvature is the Kretschmann scalar, $K = 48 M^2 / r^6$, which grows rapidly at small $r$ but stays finite at the horizon.

The toy exists to stress-test the difference between geometric, frame-invariant statements and coordinate-dependent statements that can look pathological even when the spacetime is regular. In Schwarzschild coordinates, several coordinate-time expressions become ill-behaved at $r=2M$ even though curvature invariants do not diverge there, illustrating a failure mode where “something blows up” is an artifact of the chart rather than the physics. This is exposed directly by the lapse factor for a static observer, $d\tau/dt=\sqrt{1-2M/r}$, which trends to zero as $r\to 2M^+$ and is exported as undefined (null) at or inside the horizon because the static-observer construction itself is not valid there.

To interpret the JSON, read each entry in `sample_points` as a radius-local diagnostic packet: `curvature_invariants.kretschmann` should increase strongly as $r$ decreases (tracking the $r^{-6}$ scaling), while `local_observables.tidal_eigenvalues_static_orthonormal` should scale like $M/r^3$ with a characteristic sign pattern (negative “radial”, positive “transverse”) indicating stretching vs squeezing in an orthonormal static frame. In `causal_structure.radial_null_cone_dr_dt`, the outgoing/ingoing slopes are coordinate slopes $dr/dt=\pm(1-2M/r)$, so their approach toward zero near $r=2M$ signals a coordinate-time slowdown rather than a claim that light “physically stops”; likewise `observables.gravitational_redshift_to_infinity.z` should grow as the emitter radius approaches $2M$ because it follows the same $(1-2M/r)^{-1/2}$ factor. Do not over-interpret absolute magnitudes as detector-ready predictions (they are in $G=c=1$ units and assume idealized static emitters and Schwarzschild coordinate time); instead, focus on the trends and on where the JSON intentionally uses null to mark “not defined in this coordinate/observer setup,” connecting those nulls and divergences back to the distinction between $K$ (curvature) and the $\sqrt{1-2M/r}$ and $dr/dt$ factors (coordinates/observers).

## Toy 002 — Newtonian Point-Mass Gravity as a Weak-Field Reference

This toy computes a Newtonian reference field for a point mass and exports quantities derived from the potential $\Phi(r)=-M/r$ in geometric units ($G=c=1$). The physical setup is a static, spherically symmetric source at the origin with test locations at radii $r$, and the quantities of interest are (i) the potential itself, (ii) a weak-field clock-rate proxy $d\tau/dt \approx 1+\Phi$ for a stationary observer, and (iii) the Newtonian tidal tensor eigenvalues from the Hessian of $\Phi$, which encode how nearby free-fall trajectories stretch and squeeze.

The toy exists to stress-test comparisons between “potential-based gravity” and genuinely relativistic notions of spacetime curvature and causality. It demonstrates that one can reproduce some familiar weak-field trends (time dilation and redshift) from $\Phi$ while simultaneously exposing what the Newtonian model cannot represent: curvature invariants, horizons, and light-cone structure are exported as `null` because they are not defined in this theory. Conceptually, it isolates the ambiguity that arises when one tries to treat weak-field formulas like $z \approx \Phi_\text{receiver}-\Phi_\text{emitter}$ as if they were full relativistic predictions, especially as $|\Phi|$ approaches order unity (the JSON explicitly flags the weak-field guidance rather than asserting physical validity).

To interpret the JSON, read `sample_points[*].local_observables.potential_phi` as the control knob: as $r$ decreases, $\Phi$ becomes more negative, and the weak-field clock-rate proxy `time_dilation_dtaudt_weak_field_relative_to_infinity` decreases in tandem via $1+\Phi$. The tidal signatures live in `tidal_eigenvalues_newtonian_hessian` and should scale like $r^{-3}$: the exported `radial` eigenvalue is positive ($+2M/r^3$) while the degenerate `transverse` eigenvalue is negative ($-M/r^3$), so what matters is the relative sign pattern and the rapid growth in magnitude at small $r$, not any claim about relativistic frame conventions or “true curvature.” In `observables.gravitational_redshift_weak_field`, the sign and size of `z_weak_field` track differences in $\Phi$ (e.g., emission deeper in the potential well gives a larger positive shift to infinity), but you should not over-interpret these numbers as accurate near $r\sim M$ or as evidence for horizons, invariants, or causal effects—those are intentionally absent, and the exported values are meant to connect trends back to $\Phi$ and its derivatives rather than to predict real-world strong-field behavior.

## Toy 003 — Linearized Plane Gravitational Wave in TT Gauge

This toy illustrates a weak, plane gravitational wave propagating in the $+z$ direction on an otherwise flat Minkowski background, modeled in the transverse–traceless (TT) gauge. The basic quantity of interest is the metric strain $h_{ij}^{TT}$ in the transverse $x,y$ plane, decomposed into plus and cross polarizations, and its physical manifestation through tidal forces on nearby freely falling particles. In this setup the wave has the simple form $h_+(t,z)=A_+\cos(\omega(t-z)+\phi_+)$ (with an analogous expression for $h_\times$), emphasizing that the geometry oscillates as a function of retarded time rather than static position.

The toy exists to expose a common conceptual pitfall: important gravitational effects can be present even when familiar scalar curvature invariants vanish. For plane gravitational waves, quantities such as the Ricci scalar and the Kretschmann invariant are zero at linear order, yet the spacetime is not physically trivial. The stress test here is the contrast between gauge-dependent fields like $h_{ij}^{TT}$ and genuinely observable effects encoded in the tidal tensor, defined at this order by $R_{0i0j}=-\tfrac{1}{2}\,\partial_t^2 h_{ij}^{TT}$. The toy therefore demonstrates a limitation of relying on invariants alone, rather than making any claim about realistic wave generation or detection.

The JSON output should be read as a time series of local diagnostics at a fixed $z$-plane. The oscillating signs and magnitudes of `strain_TT.h_plus` track the wave phase, while the corresponding components of `tidal_tensor_R0i0j` scale with $\omega^2 A_+$ and directly drive the reported relative accelerations in the geodesic deviation section. The small fractional length-change proxies, roughly $\Delta L/L \approx \tfrac{1}{2}h_+$ for arms aligned with the axes, indicate how a detector-like separation would respond, but their absolute values and the vanishing curvature invariants should not be over-interpreted as statements about physical energy content or strong-field behavior. Instead, the JSON values conceptually link the strain to its second time derivative and show how nonzero tidal effects coexist with invariant “silence” in this idealized linear regime.

## Toy 004 — Flat FLRW Cosmology With Analytic Expansion

This toy constructs a spatially flat ($k=0$) Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker spacetime with an analytic scale factor $a(t)$ and then reports a few geometric and observational diagnostics as functions of cosmic time $t$ in geometric units ($G=c=1$). For the provided output it uses the matter model $a(t)=(t/t_0)^{2/3}$ (with $t_0=1$), so the quantity of interest is how expansion alone shapes redshift, horizon integrals, and curvature invariants in a universe with no localized sources. A key anchor is the purely geometric redshift relation $1+z=a(t_{\mathrm{obs}})/a(t_{\mathrm{emit}})$, which ties the “observables” in the JSON directly to the chosen $a(t)$.

The toy exists to stress-test intuition and code paths around global structure in cosmology, where “horizons” and “distance” are not local objects and can be ambiguous if treated like Schwarzschild-style radii. In particular, it illustrates that particle-horizon and event-horizon notions depend on integrals of $1/a(t)$ over extended time ranges and can diverge or converge depending on the model, so a finite cutoff ($t_{\min}$ or $t_{\max}$) is part of the diagnostic rather than a prediction. For example, the comoving particle-horizon proxy is $\chi_p(t)=\int_{t_{\min}}^{t} dt'/a(t')$, which in power-law models is sensitive to how close you push $t_{\min}$ toward the Big Bang singularity. The goal is to expose limitations (cutoff dependence, divergence, and model-conditional nulls) and not to claim a physically calibrated history of our universe.

To interpret the JSON, treat each `sample_points[i]` entry as a time-slice evaluation of expansion (`local_observables`), curvature (`curvature_invariants`), and global-causal diagnostics (`causal_structure`) at the listed `coordinates.t`. In the matter run, you should see the scale factor increase with $t$, the Hubble rate `hubble_H` decrease roughly like $1/t$, the Hubble radius `hubble_radius=1/H` grow, and the curvature scalars (`ricci_scalar`, `kretschmann`) fall rapidly with time—signs that the early-time geometry is “more curved” in this symmetry-reduced sense even without any localized mass. In `observables.redshift_and_distances`, larger lookback (smaller `t_emit` at fixed `t_obs`) should correspond to larger `z` and larger `luminosity_distance_dL`, consistent with $1+z=a(t_{\mathrm{obs}})/a(t_{\mathrm{emit}})$ and the flat-FLRW relation $d_L=(1+z)\chi$ where `comoving_distance_chi` is the integral of $dt/a(t)$ from emission to observation. What you should not over-interpret are absolute numerical values as “real cosmology,” the presence/absence of an “event horizon” in non–de Sitter models (it is intentionally exported as null here), or the cutoff-dependent horizon magnitudes (`t_min_horizon` is part of the definition of `particle_horizon_comoving_chi` in this run), since these outputs are meant to demonstrate model- and definition-sensitivity rather than provide physical forecasts.
