## Toy 005 — Rindler Spacetime and the Equivalence Principle Stress Test

This toy implements the Rindler wedge description of flat spacetime, written in accelerated coordinates that make inertial Minkowski space look “gravity-like” for stationary observers at fixed $\rho>0$. The physical setup is a family of observers who sit at constant $\rho$ (and constant transverse $y,z$), measuring their local clock rate, their proper acceleration, and frequency shifts of signals exchanged between different $\rho$-stations. The quantity of interest is how apparently gravitational observables emerge from the metric coefficient $g_{tt}=-(a_0\rho)^2$, for example via the stationary redshift relation $1+z=\rho_{\mathrm{obs}}/\rho_{\mathrm{emit}}$ (where $z$ is the fractional frequency shift).

The toy exists to demonstrate a failure mode in interpretation: horizons and redshifts are not, by themselves, evidence of spacetime curvature. In Rindler coordinates there is a coordinate horizon at $\rho=0$ and stationary observers have nonzero proper acceleration $a(\rho)=1/\rho$, yet curvature invariants remain exactly zero ($R=0$ and $K=0$ everywhere), and the exported tidal components vanish. The stress test is therefore conceptual: it exposes how “gravity-like” signatures can arise from the choice of observer and coordinates rather than from tidal gravity, and it pressures any analysis pipeline to distinguish coordinate/kinematic effects from genuine curvature.

To interpret the JSON results, read each `sample_points[i]` entry as one station at a specific `rho`, with the metric time coefficient `g_tt` setting the local clock rate through `time_dilation_dtaudeta_stationary = a0*rho` and the station’s required thrust through `proper_acceleration_stationary = 1/rho`. The trend that matters is internal consistency: as `rho` increases, `time_dilation_dtaudeta_stationary` grows linearly while `proper_acceleration_stationary` falls like $1/\rho$, and the null slopes `radial_null_cone_drho_deta` scale as $\pm a_0\rho$, even though `ricci_scalar`, `kretschmann`, and `tidal_tensor_sample` remain zero—do not over-interpret the presence of a “horizon” field or large redshifts as evidence of curvature. In `observables.redshift_between_stationary_observers`, the reported `z` values (e.g., $\rho_{\mathrm{emit}}=1\to\rho_{\mathrm{obs}}=2$ gives `z=1`) should be interpreted only as the coordinate/observer redshift implied by $1+z=\rho_{\mathrm{obs}}/\rho_{\mathrm{emit}}$ and conceptually anchored to the way $g_{tt}$ changes with $\rho$, not as a prediction of tidal gravitational effects or spacetime bending.

## Toy 006 — Quasi-local Mass and Energy Diagnostics in General Relativity

This toy illustrates how different notions of mass and energy are extracted in General Relativity when a spacetime has special symmetries. The concrete setup here is the Schwarzschild vacuum solution, representing a static, spherically symmetric spacetime around a central mass parameter $M$. The quantities of interest are three commonly used mass diagnostics: the ADM mass defined at spatial infinity, the Komar mass defined for stationary spacetimes, and the Misner–Sharp mass defined quasi-locally inside a sphere of areal radius $R$, which in this case all reduce to the same constant value $M_{\mathrm{MS}} = M$.

The toy exists to stress-test the idea of “gravitational energy” in GR and to expose a well-known limitation: there is no unique, local, tensorial energy density for the gravitational field. Instead, meaningful mass or energy notions only exist when extra structure is available, such as spherical symmetry, stationarity, or asymptotic flatness. Schwarzschild spacetime satisfies all of these simultaneously, making it a deliberately simple case where the ambiguity collapses and the various definitions coincide, illustrating a best-case scenario rather than a generic physical prediction.

The JSON results should be read as consistency checks rather than measurements. Across all sampled radii, the Misner–Sharp, Komar, and ADM masses remain equal and independent of radius, while curvature invariants like the Kretschmann scalar decay rapidly with increasing $r$, signaling weaker curvature far from the source. What matters are the constancy and agreement of the mass values, not the specific numerical falloff of curvature, and one should not over-interpret these masses as local energy densities. Conceptually, the exported values demonstrate that in this symmetric vacuum case the quasi-local definition agrees with the global ones, aligning the numerical output with the defining relations used in the toy.

## Toy 007 — Horizon Pathologies in Schwarzschild vs Ingoing Eddington–Finkelstein

This toy compares two coordinate descriptions of the same Schwarzschild spacetime (a spherically symmetric vacuum geometry with mass parameter $M$) to highlight how coordinate choices can manufacture apparent “singular” behavior. It focuses on the horizon at $r=2M$, where the Schwarzschild chart uses $f(r)=1-2M/r$ and the line element $ds^2=-f\,dt^2+f^{-1}dr^2+r^2d\Omega^2$, so the coordinate component $g_{rr}=1/f$ diverges as $f\to 0$. Alongside that, it reports a curvature invariant, the Kretschmann scalar $K=48M^2/r^6$, which is a coordinate-independent diagnostic of genuine curvature growth.

The toy exists to stress-test the common failure mode of mistaking coordinate breakdown for physical pathology, and to expose how causal statements can become misleading when a chart is pushed past its domain of usefulness. In Schwarzschild $(t,r)$ coordinates, radial null directions are encoded by $dr/dt=\pm f$, so as $f\to 0$ the lightcone “freezes” in $t$, and for $r\le 2M$ the code deliberately returns these slopes as null to signal that Schwarzschild time is not a good global time coordinate there. The ingoing Eddington–Finkelstein chart, defined by $v=t+r_*$ with tortoise $r_*=r+2M\ln|r/(2M)-1|$, illustrates the complementary point: the map between $t$ and $v$ becomes singular at the horizon (because $r_*$ diverges), yet the EF metric stays regular, so the limitation is in the coordinate representation and not in the underlying geometry.

To interpret the JSON, read each `sample_points` entry as a radius-local comparison: `local_observables.f` tells you how close you are to the horizon ($f=0$ at $r=2M$), `metric_schwarzschild.g_rr` blowing up or becoming `null` flags the Schwarzschild coordinate singularity, while `metric_ingoing_ef` remaining finite (with $g_{vr}=1$ and $g_{rr}=0$) shows the EF chart’s regular extension. In `causal_structure`, the key trend is that `radial_null_cone_dr_dt` is present only for the exterior and tends toward zero magnitude as $r\to 2M^+$, whereas in EF coordinates the outgoing slope `dr_dv` follows $dr/dv=f/2$ and smoothly changes sign across the horizon, while ingoing rays are represented as `v=const`. What should not be over-interpreted is any “physical slowing” implied by small $dr/dt$ near the horizon or the exact numeric value of `tortoise_rstar` (its divergence is a coordinate artifact); instead, connect magnitudes back to the anchors $f(r)$ and $K(r)$: if $K$ stays finite at $r=2M$ (e.g., `kretschmann_at_horizon`), the toy is illustrating a coordinate limitation, not predicting a physical singularity there.

## Toy 008 — Painlevé–Gullstrand River Model at the Schwarzschild Horizon

This toy illustrates the Schwarzschild spacetime written in ingoing Painlevé–Gullstrand coordinates, which replace the usual static time with a slicing adapted to freely falling observers. The physical picture is the “river model,” where space itself flows radially inward with speed $v(r)=-\sqrt{2M/r}$ toward the central mass $M$. In these coordinates the metric remains regular at the horizon and radial light propagation is especially transparent, since radial null curves satisfy the simple relation $dr/dt=v\pm1$, making the behavior of light cones easy to visualize across $r=2M$.

The toy exists to stress-test the idea that the Schwarzschild horizon is a physical singularity by exposing how that impression depends on coordinates. In Schwarzschild $t$ coordinates the horizon appears pathological, but in PG coordinates the same geometry is smooth, even though the curvature invariant $K=48M^2/r^6$ is unchanged. The limitation being illustrated is therefore conceptual rather than physical: coordinate choices can obscure or exaggerate features like horizons, and this toy demonstrates that the “freezing” of outgoing light at the horizon arises from $|v|=1$, not from divergent curvature or breakdown of the spacetime description.

The JSON output should be read as a collection of sample radii showing how geometric and causal quantities behave relative to the horizon. Key trends are that the river speed approaches $-1$ at $r=2M$, the outgoing null slope $dr/dt$ goes to zero there, and the Kretschmann scalar remains finite, while inside the horizon both ingoing and outgoing slopes are negative. Magnitudes and signs of $v$ and $dr/dt$ matter for interpreting causal flow, but individual numeric values should not be over-interpreted as predictions of dynamics. Instead, they should be connected back to the relations $v(r)=-\sqrt{2M/r}$ and $dr/dt=v\pm1$, which the JSON encodes pointwise to illustrate coordinate regularity and horizon behavior rather than new physics.

## Toy 009 — Radial Infall Time: Proper vs Schwarzschild vs PG

This toy computes a single, idealized trajectory: a massive particle falling radially inward in Schwarzschild spacetime, with specific energy $E=1$ (“released from rest at infinity”) and starting at radius $r_0$. The quantity of interest is how different time coordinates assign “time to fall” along the same geometric path, using the shared radial kinematics $dr/d\tau=-\sqrt{2M/r}$ where $\tau$ is the infaller’s proper time and $M$ is the black-hole mass parameter in $G=c=1$ units.

The toy exists to expose a coordinate failure mode that can look like physics if you forget which clock you are using: Schwarzschild coordinate time becomes pathological at the horizon. For this infall, the Schwarzschild relation $dt/d\tau=1/(1-2M/r)$ blows up as $r\to 2M^+$ even though the spacetime curvature is perfectly regular there, so “it takes infinite time to reach the horizon” is a chart artifact rather than a physical prediction. The stress test is: can your interpretation pipeline keep “divergent coordinate time” separate from “finite proper time” when both are produced from the same geometry?

To interpret the JSON, treat each `sample_points[i]` entry as one radius $r$ where the toy reports (i) curvature invariants, (ii) local kinematics, and (iii) integrated times from $r_0$. The key trend is that `times_from_r0.tau_proper` stays finite and smoothly approaches the horizon-crossing value (see `observables.time_to_horizon.tau_proper_from_r0`), while `times_from_r0.t_schwarzschild` grows rapidly as $r$ approaches `horizon_radius=2M` and becomes `null` at and below the horizon; likewise `kinematics.dt_dtau_schwarzschild` becomes huge near $2M$ and is `null` for $r\le 2M$. Do not over-interpret the absolute magnitudes as “real delay” or “observed time at infinity”: the point is the sign and divergence structure—finite $\tau$ versus divergent $t$—and that `t_painleve_gullstrand` is exported to match $\tau$ for this specific $E=1$ infall, conceptually reflecting $\Delta t_{\mathrm{PG}}=\Delta\tau$ while both remain tied to the same $dr/d\tau$ evolution.

## Toy 010 — Schwarzschild Circular Orbits: Photon Sphere and ISCO via Effective Potentials

This toy catalogs the orbit structure of the Schwarzschild spacetime (a non-rotating black hole) by evaluating the effective radial potentials that govern geodesic motion and by exporting the special radii where qualitatively new behavior appears. In geometric units ($G=c=1$) with mass parameter $M$, it uses the standard “energy balance” form $(dr/d\tau)^2 + V_{\mathrm{eff}}(r;L)=E^2$ (timelike) and $(dr/d\lambda)^2 + V_{\mathrm{eff}}(r;L)=E^2$ (null) to connect the physical setup—test particles or photons moving in the exterior region—to the quantity of interest: which radii admit circular orbits, and whether those circular orbits are stable or unstable.

The toy exists to expose a conceptual stress point where Newtonian intuition fails: even in a perfectly smooth vacuum region (no matter and no curvature singularity), the space of allowed circular orbits changes character in a sharply GR-specific way. It demonstrates that circular timelike orbits only exist for $r>3M$ and that stability switches at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) $r=6M$, while null circular orbits collapse to a single unstable photon sphere at $r=3M$ with impact parameter $b=L/E=3\sqrt{3}\,M$. These are not “predictions” about real astrophysical accretion disks; they are a limitation test showing that the same-looking effective-potential machinery can encode existence and stability boundaries that are easy to misread if one assumes all circular orbits are alike.

To interpret the JSON, read each entry in `sample_points` as a radius-local snapshot: `local_observables.f` is the Schwarzschild redshift factor $f(r)=1-2M/r$, `effective_potentials_at_L_probe` reports the timelike and null $V_{\mathrm{eff}}$ evaluated at a fixed probe angular momentum, and `timelike_circular_orbit_if_exists` reports the *derived* circular-orbit integrals ($L^2$ and $E^2$) when they exist. The key trend is the regime change across the exported special radii: below `photon_sphere_3M` the timelike circular-orbit fields become null (no solution), between $3M$ and $6M$ the toy marks timelike circular orbits as “unstable,” and for $r>6M$ it marks them “stable,” while only the point with `r=3M` populates `null_circular_orbit_if_photon_sphere` with the unstable photon-sphere data and the associated `impact_parameter_b`. What should not be over-interpreted are the absolute values of `Veff_*` at `L_probe` (they are a sampling aid, not an invariant “potential energy”) and the coordinate frequency `omega_coordinate` (useful for consistency checks, but not a local observable); instead, connect the exported `E2`, `L2`, and stability labels back to the circular-orbit condition $dV_{\mathrm{eff}}/dr=0$ and to the idea that stability is about whether small radial perturbations see a restoring tendency in the effective-potential landscape.
