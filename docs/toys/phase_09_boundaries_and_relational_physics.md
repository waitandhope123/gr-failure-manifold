## Toy 051 — ADM Initial Data Underdetermination

This toy illustrates how the same flat spacetime can admit different sets of ADM initial data depending on how spacetime is sliced into spatial hypersurfaces. The physical setup is Minkowski spacetime, examined at a single spatial point, but foliated by two different time coordinates: an inertial slicing and an accelerated (Rindler-like) slicing. In both cases the intrinsic three-metric is flat, while the quantity of interest is the extrinsic curvature $K_{ij}$, which encodes how each spatial slice is embedded in spacetime and may be summarized by a nonzero or vanishing trace.

The toy exists to expose a limitation of the ADM initial value formulation rather than to make a physical prediction. It demonstrates that specifying the intrinsic geometry alone does not uniquely determine the extrinsic curvature, because $K_{ij}$ depends on the choice of time foliation via $K_{ij} = -\tfrac{1}{2}\mathcal{L}_n \gamma_{ij}$, where $\gamma_{ij}$ is the spatial metric and $n$ is the unit normal to the slice. This underdetermination is a stress test for any interpretation that treats ADM data as directly encoding physical content without fixing gauge or slicing, even when curvature invariants indicate an identical spacetime.

The JSON results should be read as a controlled comparison between two slicings of the same geometry. The identical values of the Ricci scalar and Kretschmann invariant indicate that spacetime curvature is zero in both cases, while the differing components of $K_{ij}$ and its trace signal a slicing-dependent embedding of the same flat three-metric. The presence or absence of a horizon flag reflects observer-dependent causal structure and should not be over-interpreted as a change in spacetime itself. Conceptually, the numerical values of $K_{ij}$ connect back to the definition of extrinsic curvature as a measure of how rapidly the spatial metric changes along the chosen time direction, not as an invariant property of the spacetime.

## Toy 052 — Gauge Mode Amplitude vs Physical Curvature

This toy compares two linearized perturbations of flat spacetime: a physical transverse–traceless (TT) plane wave and a deliberately constructed pure gauge perturbation. Both live on a Minkowski background and are evaluated pointwise, but they differ in what they represent physically. The quantity of interest is how large the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ can become relative to a simple curvature diagnostic, with the physical TT wave defined by $h_{yy}=A_{\text{phys}}\cos(k(t-x))$ and $h_{zz}=-A_{\text{phys}}\cos(k(t-x))$ as a reference signal.

The toy exists to expose a conceptual failure mode common in numerical relativity and related codes: large metric components do not imply large physical gravity. By building a perturbation explicitly as a diffeomorphism, $h_{\mu\nu}=\partial_\mu\xi_\nu+\partial_\nu\xi_\mu$, the model produces order-unity variations in $h_{\mu\nu}$ while the linearized Riemann tensor vanishes identically. This is framed as a stress test of diagnostics rather than a prediction: monitoring $h_{\mu\nu}$ alone conflates gauge activity with physical curvature and can falsely suggest instability or growth even when no invariant gravitational content is present.

The JSON output should be read comparatively across the two models. The key trend is that `max_abs_h_pure_gauge_over_grid` is orders of magnitude larger than its physical TT counterpart, while the linearized curvature proxy $K_{\text{lin}}=R_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}R^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}$ remains numerically zero across the sampled grid for both cases. The sign and phase of individual components (such as `h_ty_pure_gauge` or `h_yy_physical_TT`) are not themselves meaningful and should not be over-interpreted; what matters is the contrast between large gauge-driven amplitudes and vanishing invariant diagnostics. The JSON values therefore illustrate how the scalar built from the Riemann tensor connects back to the defining equations conceptually, while also demonstrating the limitation of using either raw metric components or a single curvature proxy as a stand-alone measure of physical gravity.

## Toy 053 — Anisotropic-Stress TOV Star and Compactness Diagnostics

This toy integrates the static, spherically symmetric Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff system for a self-gravitating fluid sphere while allowing for anisotropic stress, where the radial pressure $p_r$ can differ from the tangential pressure $p_t$. The physical setup fixes an equation of state $p_r = w\rho$ and an explicit anisotropy $\Delta = p_t - p_r$, and then follows how mass $m(r)$, pressure, and the metric potential evolve with radius under gravity. The primary quantity of interest is the star’s compactness, measured locally by $2m(r)/r$ and globally by $2M/R$, which indicates how close the configuration comes to forming a trapped surface.

The toy exists to expose a limitation of perfect-fluid intuition in relativistic stellar structure. Many collapse or horizon-proximity arguments implicitly assume isotropic pressure, yet the force balance equation $dp_r/dr = -(\rho+p_r)(m+4\pi r^3 p_r)/(r(r-2m)) + 2\Delta/r$ shows that anisotropy directly alters support against gravity without changing the spacetime symmetry. This is framed as a stress test of diagnostic criteria—such as compactness thresholds or Buchdahl-like bounds—rather than a prediction of realistic stellar behavior, emphasizing that “collapse” signals depend on matter-model assumptions as much as on geometry.

The JSON output should be read as a set of radial samples and global summaries that illustrate these points. In the provided run with $\alpha=0$ (no anisotropy), the pressure decreases slowly and never reaches zero before the integration cutoff, so no surface is found and the reported radius is simply the maximum integration radius; nevertheless, the compactness saturates around $2M/R \simeq 0.34$ and the trapped-surface indicator remains false everywhere. Trends that matter are monotonic growth of $m(r)$, the approach of $2m/r$ to a plateau, and the smooth decline of curvature scalars, all consistent with a diffuse, non-collapsing configuration. What should not be over-interpreted are absolute mass or radius values, the vacuum-like Kretschmann proxy inside the matter, or the absence of a surface as a physical statement; these numbers only connect back conceptually to the equations as indicators of how the chosen stress model populates the balance between pressure and gravity.

## Toy 054 — Imperfect Fluid Entropy Production on a Prescribed FLRW Background

This toy tracks irreversible dissipation for a homogeneous fluid evolving on a fixed, expanding flat FLRW spacetime with scale factor $a(t)=(t/t_0)^p$. The quantity of interest is the entropy production rate density associated with viscosity during expansion, computed from the background kinematics via the Hubble rate $H=\dot a/a=p/t$ and the expansion scalar $\theta=3H$. Because exact FLRW symmetry has zero shear, the toy introduces a small “shear proxy” $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{proxy}}=\beta H^2$ as a controlled perturbation-like bookkeeping device for dissipation.

The point of the toy is to illustrate a limitation/stress test of “GR + matter” modeling: once dissipative transport is admitted, the evolution is no longer time-reversal invariant, yet the transport coefficients are not determined by GR itself. In first-order relativistic hydrodynamics the entropy production is tied directly to viscous stresses, here represented by $T\nabla_a s^a \approx 2\eta\,\sigma^2_{\mathrm{proxy}}$, so choosing $\eta$ (and the proxy strength $\beta$) injects an arrow of time that is conceptually consistent but physically underdetermined. The toy therefore demonstrates how irreversible behavior can be present even when the background geometry is fully prescribed and deterministic, emphasizing that the “missing principle” is the microphysical closure for transport rather than any geometric constraint.

To read the JSON, focus on how the kinematic fields set the dissipation scale: `hubble_parameter_H` decreases as $p/t$, `expansion_scalar_theta` follows $3H$, and `shear_squared_proxy` follows $\beta H^2$, so `entropy_production_rate_density` should fall roughly like $H^2\propto t^{-2}$ for fixed $(\eta,\beta)$. The key diagnostic is monotonic growth of `cumulative_entropy_density`, with the final `total_entropy_produced` giving the integrated effect over the sampled time steps; its absolute magnitude is only meaningful relative to the chosen units and the phenomenological inputs $(\eta,\beta)$, and should not be over-interpreted as a physical prediction. Conceptually, the JSON values connect back by showing that curvature/expansion (e.g., `ricci_scalar_R` and $H$) set the dynamical scale while the entropy growth is controlled by the imposed transport law $T\nabla_a s^a \approx 2\eta\,\beta H^2$, so trends and signs (positive production when $\eta\beta>0$) matter more than any single number.

## Toy 055 — Boxed Boundaries for Scalar Waves on Schwarzschild

This toy evolves a massless scalar field $\psi(t,r^\*)$ on a fixed Schwarzschild exterior using a 1+1 dimensional wave equation with an effective curvature potential, treating the geometry as static and non-dynamical. The field propagates in the tortoise coordinate $r^\*$, which stretches the near-horizon region, and is initialized as a Gaussian pulse that travels inward and outward across the domain. The quantity of interest is an energy-like functional constructed from time derivatives, spatial derivatives in $r^\*$, and the effective potential, conceptually summarized as $$E=\tfrac12\int\!\big[(\partial_t\psi)^2+(\partial_{r^\*}\psi)^2+V(r)\psi^2\big]\,dr^\*$$ where $V(r)$ is the scalar Regge–Wheeler–type potential determined by the Schwarzschild mass $M$ and multipole index $\ell$.

The purpose of the toy is not to model physical scalar radiation, but to expose how finite-radius boundaries act as hidden physics inputs in numerical relativity–style simulations. Even when the local evolution equation $\partial_t^2\psi-\partial_{r^\*}^2\psi+V(r)\psi=0$ is well behaved, imposing boundary conditions at finite $r^\*$ can inject spurious reflections, distort flux balance, and destroy any meaningful notion of energy conservation. The toy is therefore a stress test of asymptotic assumptions: it demonstrates that “absorbing” or “reflective” boundaries are approximations whose failures can masquerade as genuine late-time tails or instabilities, rather than predictions of general relativity itself.

The JSON output should be read with this limitation firmly in mind. The `energy_time_series` tracks the diagnostic energy as a function of time; the key signals are qualitative trends such as monotonic decay, plateauing, oscillation, or runaway growth, not the absolute magnitudes. Large positive `fractional_energy_drift` or a substantial `reflection_bump_proxy` indicate boundary-induced contamination rather than physical amplification, even when the outer boundary is labeled “absorbing.” The `sample_points` connect local values of $\psi$ and the effective potential back to the energy definition, but they should not be over-interpreted as physical observables or curvature effects; they merely illustrate how boundary behavior feeds back into the energy integral through the same terms that appear in the defining equation.

## Toy 056 — Relational distance via radar ranging

This toy illustrates how “distance” in curved spacetime is an operational quantity rather than an intrinsic scalar. The setup is the Schwarzschild exterior spacetime, with a static observer at radius $r_1$ who measures the distance to a target radius $r_2>r_1$ by sending a light signal out and back and recording the elapsed proper time on their own clock. The resulting radar distance is defined as $D_{\text{radar}}=\Delta\tau/2$, where $\Delta\tau=\sqrt{1-2M/r_1}\,\Delta t_{\text{round}}$ is the proper round-trip time and $\Delta t_{\text{round}}$ is the Schwarzschild-coordinate light travel time.

The toy exists to expose a conceptual limitation: even when staying within a single spacetime solution, different operational protocols give different answers for “the distance between two radii.” As a contrast, the toy computes the proper spatial distance along a Schwarzschild $t=\text{const}$ slice, $D_{\text{slice}}=\int_{r_1}^{r_2}dr/\sqrt{1-2M/r}$, which depends on a particular foliation rather than on a measurement procedure tied to an observer. The discrepancy between $D_{\text{radar}}$ and $D_{\text{slice}}$ is not a prediction about which is “right,” but a stress test showing that distance is protocol- and observer-dependent, especially near the horizon where both constructions diverge in different ways.

The JSON output lists, for many $(r_1,r_2)$ pairs, the coordinate separation $\Delta r$, the radar distance, the slice distance, and their ratio, along with redshift factors at $r_1$. Trends to attend to are that $D_{\text{radar}}$ is systematically smaller than $D_{\text{slice}}$ for the same pair and that the ratio approaches unity only far from the horizon, while both distances grow large as $r_1\to2M^+$. Values that are null correspond to invalid domains (such as $r_2\le r_1$) and should not be interpreted physically. The numbers should not be over-interpreted as measurements of “true” separation; they are concrete realizations of the defining equations, demonstrating how different operational definitions map the same geometry to different numerical distances.

## Toy 057 — Gravitational-Wave Memory as an Extended Detector Observable

This toy illustrates how a gravitational-wave burst with memory produces a permanent displacement in a finite detector even though the local spacetime curvature vanishes before and after the wave passes. The setup is linearized general relativity on flat spacetime, with a plane transverse–traceless wave propagating in the $+x$ direction and a detector consisting of two freely falling test masses separated along $y$. The quantity of interest is the detector’s proper separation $L(u)$ as a function of retarded time $u$, which responds directly to the TT strain through $L(u)\approx L_0(1+\tfrac{1}{2}h(u))$.

The toy exists to expose a limitation of purely local, instantaneous diagnostics of gravitational fields. In this model the relevant tidal curvature component is $R_{tyty}=-\tfrac{1}{2}d^2h/du^2$, which is nonzero only during the brief transition of the wave and returns to nearly zero at early and late times. The stress test is that, despite this vanishing curvature, the detector records a lasting offset because the observable depends on the time-integrated history of the strain rather than its pointwise value, highlighting how local curvature scalars can miss extended-in-time physical effects.

The JSON output should be read by comparing early and late samples in retarded time. The key signal of memory is that the detector separation changes from its initial value to a shifted final value, with a measured fractional change $\Delta L/L_0$ close to $\tfrac{1}{2}(h_{\text{final}}-h_{\text{initial}})\approx h_{\text{mem}}/2$, while curvature-related entries such as $R_{tyty}$ and its quadratic proxy peak only near the transition and are negligible elsewhere. The magnitude and sign of the late-time offset matter, but the detailed shape of the transient curvature or the exact numerical peak values should not be over-interpreted, as they only serve to connect the sampled JSON values back to the conceptual relation between transient curvature and permanent detector response.

## Toy 058 — Thin-Shell Junction: Minkowski Interior to Schwarzschild Exterior

This toy simulates a spherically symmetric, pressureless thin shell at areal radius $R(\tau)$ that separates a flat (Minkowski) interior from a Schwarzschild exterior of mass $M$ (with $G=c=1$), and it evolves the shell’s proper-time motion on the collapsing branch. The quantity of interest is not a local curvature scalar but the shell’s distributional content encoded in the mismatch between the two geometries at the shell. The shell’s kinematics follow an energy-type relation derived from the Israel junction condition, $Rdot^2 = (M/m0 + m0/(2R))^2 - 1$, where $m0$ is the shell rest mass and $Rdot=dR/d\tau$.

The toy exists to expose a common failure mode in “gluing spacetimes”: two regions can each look perfectly regular (even vacuum-like) when examined with standard invariants, yet the act of matching them across a hypersurface forces a delta-function stress-energy on that hypersurface. In this setup, the conceptual stress test is that the shell’s physical content lives in the jump of extrinsic curvature rather than in the interior/exterior Ricci or Kretschmann scalars, and sign conventions matter. The core principle is the junction statement $[K^\theta_{\ \theta}] = K^\theta_{\ \theta}(\mathrm{out}) - K^\theta_{\ \theta}(\mathrm{in}) = -m0/R^2$ (equivalently $-4\pi\sigma$ with $\sigma=m0/(4\pi R^2)$), which should be treated as an implementation check, not a physical prediction.

To interpret the JSON, focus on how the exported “local_observables” and “curvature_invariants” tell different stories: the invariants remain vacuum-like (Ricci scalars are zero on both sides, and the exterior Kretschmann at the shell stays finite), while the shell’s presence shows up as a nonzero “jump_Ktheta_out_minus_in” tracking the expected scaling “jump_Ktheta_expected_minus_m0_over_R2” and a near-zero “jump_Ktheta_residual” (here at floating-error level). Trends that matter are the sign and magnitude of the jump (negative for positive $m0$ in this convention) and whether it scales like $1/R^2$ as $R$ changes; in this particular run $R$ stays at $10$ so the jump and $\sigma$ remain constant, illustrating a static corner case rather than collapse. Do not over-interpret “inside_horizon” or the lack of horizon crossing as dynamical evidence—these outputs are bookkeeping tied to $2M$ and the chosen branch—while the meaningful consistency link is that the reported $K^\theta_{\ \theta}(\pm)\sim \sqrt{Rdot^2+f_\pm}/R$ combine to reproduce the stated jump relation that conceptually underlies the evolution equation.

## Toy 059 — Shell Crossing and Multi-Stream Breakdown in Dust

This toy simulates the radial motion of many non-interacting spherical dust shells under their mutual gravity, each labeled by an initial radius $r_0$ and evolved independently in time. The physical setup is intentionally simple: shells fall according to a fixed enclosed mass profile while carrying an initially prescribed inward velocity gradient. The central quantity of interest is the mapping from initial position to current position, $r(t;r_0)$, because it encodes whether the flow remains single-valued or develops multi-stream structure. Shell crossing is diagnosed when this mapping ceases to be monotonic, formally when the Jacobian $\partial r/\partial r_0$ vanishes.

The toy exists to illustrate a specific limitation of dust or perfect-fluid descriptions rather than to make any physical prediction. In such matter models, density is inferred from the continuity of flow lines, but this inference fails when multiple streams occupy the same location. Here, density is estimated as $\rho=\rho_0(r_0^2/r^2)(1/J)$ with $J=\partial r/\partial r_0$, so $\rho$ diverges as $J\to0$ even if the shells remain at finite radius. This demonstrates a stress test of the matter model: singular behavior can arise from multi-streaming without any corresponding blow-up in spacetime curvature, exposing an ambiguity between “matter singularities” and geometric ones.

The JSON output should be read as a collection of sampled shell histories and summary diagnostics rather than as a detailed spacetime solution. Trends to watch are decreases in the Jacobian toward zero, corresponding spikes in the estimated density, and the behavior of the curvature proxy $K_\text{proxy}\sim48M_\text{enclosed}^2/r^6$, which typically remains finite at shell crossing. Flags indicating $J\le0$ or very small $|J|$ mark the onset of multi-stream breakdown. These values should not be over-interpreted as true physical densities or curvature invariants; they are bookkeeping devices tied directly to the defining equations and are meant only to show that density divergence can precede, and be independent of, any curvature growth.

## Toy 060 — GR vs Scalar Gravity Redshift Comparator

This toy computes the gravitational frequency shift between two static observers at radii $r_1$ (emitter) and $r_2$ (receiver) around a point mass $M$ in units with $G=c=1$. It runs the same “observable” pipeline twice: once using a weak-field Schwarzschild redshift baseline for GR and once using a conformally flat scalar-gravity metric with $\phi(r)=\exp(-M/r)$, reporting the redshift $z$ each model assigns to the same geometric setup. The orienting observable is the redshift itself, e.g. $z_{\mathrm{GR}}=\sqrt{(1-2M/r_2)/(1-2M/r_1)}-1$.

The toy exists to stress-test an easy-to-miss ambiguity: reproducing the Newtonian limit and “having a redshift” does not uniquely identify GR, because alternative metric theories can be arranged to agree at leading order while diverging beyond it. In this comparator, the scalar model is constructed so that $\phi(r)$ encodes the Newtonian potential at lowest order, yet it produces a different mapping from $(M,r_1,r_2)$ to $z$, thereby exposing which conclusions are model-dependent rather than GR-specific. Read the output as a limitation demo—an internal consistency check across theories—rather than a physical prediction, with the key contrast anchored by $z_{\mathrm{scalar}}=\phi(r_1)/\phi(r_2)-1=\exp(M(1/r_2-1/r_1))-1$.

In the JSON, each entry in `sample_points` contains `coordinates` ($r_{\mathrm{emitter}}=r_1$, $r_{\mathrm{receiver}}=r_2$), `local_observables` (the two redshifts and the relative deviation), and `curvature_invariants` (a GR strength proxy via the Kretschmann scalar and a scalar-model strength proxy via its Ricci scalar). The most important trends are: (i) the sign and magnitude of `redshift_GR` versus `redshift_scalar_gravity` for the same pair $(r_1,r_2)$, and (ii) how `relative_difference_(scalar_minus_GR)_over_GR` grows in magnitude as the field becomes stronger (for these samples, the summary reports a maximum absolute relative deviation of about $1.90$). Do not over-interpret the scalar-model curvature values or the absence of a `scalar_gravity_horizon` as statements about real astrophysical spacetimes; they are diagnostics tied to the specific choice $\phi(r)=\exp(-M/r)$, meant only to contextualize when the comparator is far from the weak-field regime where both models share the same leading-order potential, and to connect back conceptually to how the reported $z$ values arise from the respective metric time components in the two formulas above.
