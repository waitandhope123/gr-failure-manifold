## Toy 011 — Thin Spherical Dust Shell Backreaction via Israel Junction Conditions

This toy models an infinitesimally thin, spherically symmetric dust shell with rest mass $m_\text{shell}$ separating two vacuum regions: an interior Schwarzschild spacetime of mass $M_\text{in}$ (here often $0$, i.e., Minkowski) and an exterior Schwarzschild spacetime of mass $M_\text{out}$. The quantity of interest is the shell’s radial motion in its own proper time $\tau$ and how that motion depends on the *conserved* mass jump $\Delta M = M_\text{out}-M_\text{in}$ rather than on $m_\text{shell}$ alone. Operationally, the toy evaluates the shell equation of motion at selected areal radii $R$ using $$R\dot{}^{\,2}=\left(\Delta M/m_\text{shell}+m_\text{shell}/(2R)\right)^2-\left(1-2M_\text{in}/R\right),$$ where $R\dot{}=dR/d\tau$ and the bracketed term is the interior metric function.

The point of the toy is to expose the conceptual mismatch between “how much stuff is on the shell” (its rest mass) and “how much mass the spacetime has at infinity” (the exterior ADM mass), which can differ because binding and kinetic contributions are folded into $\Delta M$. In other words, even a shell with small or moderate $m_\text{shell}$ can correspond to a much larger (or smaller) change in the global mass parameter, and horizon formation is set by the exterior boundary condition $r_h=2M_\text{out}$ rather than by any local diagnostic at the shell. The stress test is to treat $M_\text{in}$, $M_\text{out}$, and $m_\text{shell}$ as independently specified conserved inputs and see when the resulting kinematics become inconsistent (e.g., $R\dot{}^{\,2}<0$ at a proposed radius), and to track how the “binding energy” proxy $E_\text{bind}=\Delta M-m_\text{shell}$ signals that $\Delta M$ is not a naive rest-mass bookkeeping device.

To read the JSON, start with `observables.global` and `parameters`: they tell you $M_\text{in}$, $M_\text{out}$, $m_\text{shell}$, $\Delta M$, $E_\text{bind}$, and the horizon radii `r_h_*_2M_*`. Each entry in `sample_points` is a radius slice at `coordinates.R`, reporting `local_observables.shell_equation_of_motion.Rdot2` and its sign (motion allowed if $\ge 0$), plus `V_eff_defined_by_Rdot2_plus_Veff_eq_0` which is just $V_\text{eff}=-R\dot{}^{\,2}$ for bookkeeping, and horizon offsets like `R_minus_r_h_out` that change sign when the sampled radius crosses $2M_\text{out}$. The trends that matter are (i) whether `Rdot2` stays positive or approaches zero (a turning point flag would trip only when $R\dot{}^{\,2}\approx 0$), (ii) how the region classification flips at $R=2M_\text{out}$ even though interior invariants may remain trivial, and (iii) how curvature scalars like the exterior Kretschmann value fall rapidly with $R$ without saying anything by themselves about the presence of an exterior horizon; you should not over-interpret any single `kretschmann` magnitude as a “black hole detector” or treat `Rdot` values as physical predictions, since they are tied to the toy’s conserved-mass inputs and the idealized junction equation rather than to a full dynamical collapse with radiation or pressure. Conceptually, the JSON fields map back to the equation above by showing how $\Delta M/m_\text{shell}$ and $m_\text{shell}/(2R)$ compete against the interior $f_\text{in}(R)=1-2M_\text{in}/R$ to set $R\dot{}^{\,2}$, while the horizon-related fields illustrate that $2M_\text{out}$ is a global label that can dominate causal interpretation even when local diagnostics vary smoothly.

## Toy 012 — Kerr Spacetime: Horizons, Ergosphere, and Frame Dragging

This toy illustrates how rotation reshapes the causal and kinematic structure of spacetime in the Kerr solution of general relativity. It samples the Kerr metric in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates at selected radii $r$ and polar angles $\theta$, focusing on three geometric features: the horizons defined by $\Delta(r)=0$, the ergosphere defined by $g_{tt}(r,\theta)=0$, and the frame-dragging experienced by locally non-rotating observers (ZAMOs). A central quantity of interest is the ZAMO angular velocity $\omega$, which captures how spacetime itself “drags” inertial frames according to $\omega = 2Mar/A$, where $M$ is the mass, $a$ the spin parameter, and $A$ a Kerr metric function.

The toy exists to expose a conceptual pressure point introduced by rotation: the separation between the event horizon and the static limit. In non-rotating spacetimes these coincide, but in Kerr they do not, producing an ergoregion outside the outer horizon where static observers cannot exist even though escape to infinity remains possible. This is not a physical prediction engine but a stress test for intuition, demonstrating how coordinate-dependent notions (like “being at rest”) fail when $g_{tt}$ changes sign, and how invariant or quasi-invariant diagnostics must be used carefully to interpret rotating geometries.

The JSON output should be read as a catalog of sampled spacetime points and global surface properties. Signs and magnitudes matter: positive $g_{tt}$ flags the ergoregion, vanishing $\alpha=\sqrt{\Delta\Sigma/A}$ signals approach to the outer horizon, and decreasing $\omega$ with increasing $r$ reflects weakening frame dragging far from the black hole. Angular dependence is encoded through $\theta$-dependent ergosurface radii and variations in metric components. These values should not be over-interpreted as dynamical predictions or observational signals; they simply instantiate the defining equations—such as $\Delta=0$ and $g_{tt}=0$—at discrete points to illustrate how horizons, ergospheres, and frame dragging coexist and differ in Kerr spacetime.

## Toy 013 — Kerr ISCO Shift and Thin-Disk Efficiency Proxy

This toy computes how the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of a Kerr black hole depends on spin and orbital alignment, and how that shift feeds into a simple proxy for accretion efficiency. The physical setup is an equatorial test particle moving on circular geodesics around a rotating black hole of mass $M$ and spin $a$, with the quantity of interest taken to be the specific energy at the ISCO, $E_{\mathrm{ISCO}}$, from which an idealized radiative efficiency is defined as $\eta \approx 1 - E_{\mathrm{ISCO}}$. By comparing aligned (prograde) and antialigned (retrograde) orbits, the toy isolates how rotation alone reshapes the stability boundary and the available binding energy.

The toy exists to stress-test a common intuition: that “spin increases efficiency” in a straightforward, physical sense. What it actually demonstrates is a geometric sensitivity—small changes in the dimensionless spin parameter $a/M$ can move the ISCO dramatically, especially for aligned orbits, without invoking any additional physics beyond vacuum geodesics. This exposes a conceptual limitation of interpreting $\eta$ as a prediction: it is a diagnostic of how the geodesic energy $E(r)$ behaves near the stability threshold, not a claim about real disks, radiation, or astrophysical luminosities, and it deliberately ignores effects that would modify $\eta$ beyond the ideal relation $\eta \approx 1 - E_{\mathrm{ISCO}}$.

The JSON output should be read as a set of sampled points in parameter space, each labeled by spin $a$, alignment branch, and the resulting ISCO properties. The most important trends are the monotonic decrease of $r_{\mathrm{ISCO}}$ and increase of $\eta$ for aligned orbits as $|a|$ approaches $M$, contrasted with the outward shift and low efficiency for antialigned orbits; the sign and magnitude of $\eta$ are what matter, not small numerical differences. Values such as the Kretschmann scalar or the distances between the ISCO and the horizon or ergosurface provide geometric context but should not be over-interpreted as indicators of physical stress or observability. Conceptually, all reported quantities trace back to evaluating the circular-orbit energy $E(r)$ at the spin-dependent ISCO radius and then mapping that energy into the efficiency proxy through $\eta \approx 1 - E_{\mathrm{ISCO}}$.

## Toy 014 — Kerr Horizon Mechanics: Irreducible Mass and Extractable Spin Energy

This toy samples a Kerr black hole with mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$ (in geometric units with $G=c=1$) and computes horizon-based quantities that tie geometry to a global “energy bookkeeping” picture. When a horizon exists ($|a|\le M$), it evaluates the outer/inner horizon radii $r_\pm = M \pm \sqrt{M^2-a^2}$ and uses the outer radius to form the horizon area and the associated irreducible mass. The central quantity of interest is the rotational energy budget inferred from the horizon area, summarized by $E_{\rm rot}=M-M_{\rm irr}$ (with $M_{\rm irr}$ the irreducible mass), alongside horizon kinematics such as the angular velocity $\Omega_H$ and surface gravity $\kappa$.

The toy exists to stress-test a common conceptual failure mode: treating “energy stored in rotation” as if it were a local density rather than a global, invariant-ish statement tied to horizon geometry. In Kerr, the clean handle is that the horizon area fixes $M_{\rm irr}$, and reversible extraction processes can at best reduce $M$ toward $M_{\rm irr}$ without decreasing the area, so the gap $E_{\rm rot}=M-M_{\rm irr}$ is an idealized upper bound rather than a prediction of any particular mechanism. The code also deliberately probes the boundary of validity by including $|a|>M$, where the discriminant $M^2-a^2<0$ and the horizon disappears; in that regime it exports nulls to make the “no horizon, no horizon mechanics” limitation explicit.

To interpret the JSON, read each entry in `sample_points` as one parameter-space sample labeled by `coordinates.a` (and `a_over_M`), and first check `causal_structure.horizon_exists`: if it is false, all horizon-derived outputs (e.g., `r_plus`, `area_A`, `irreducible_mass_Mirr`, `extractable_rotational_energy_Erot`, `Omega_H`, `surface_gravity_kappa`, and the horizon Kretschmann diagnostic) are null by construction. When `horizon_exists` is true, the main trend to watch is that `energetics.extractable_fraction_Erot_over_M` grows with $|a|/M$ and approaches the reference extremal limit $\approx 1-1/\sqrt{2}\simeq 0.2929$, while `horizon_kinematics.surface_gravity_kappa` decreases toward 0 as the spin approaches extremality and `horizon_kinematics.Omega_H` tracks the sign of $a$ (positive for $a>0$, negative for $a<0$). What should not be over-interpreted is any claim of “how much energy you will actually get” or any physical meaning assigned to the $|a|>M$ samples; the reported values are best read as a consistency map of the relations between $r_+$, the area-defined $M_{\rm irr}$, and the derived bound $E_{\rm rot}=M-M_{\rm irr}$, with the JSON fields acting as labeled outputs of those equations rather than empirical observables.

## Toy 015 — Kerr Superradiance Window and Ergoregion Energetics

This toy samples the kinematics of the Kerr spacetime to illustrate where energy extraction mechanisms become possible without solving any dynamical scattering problem. It evaluates whether spacetime points lie in the ergoregion, where the time-translation Killing vector becomes spacelike, and records the horizon angular velocity that controls rotational energy flow. The central quantities are the sign of the metric component $g_{tt}$ and the horizon angular velocity $\Omega_H$, with the ergoregion identified by $g_{tt}>0$ and the horizon defined (when it exists) at $r_+=M+\sqrt{M^2-a^2}$.

The purpose of the toy is to expose a conceptual pressure point in black-hole physics: global energy notions depend on spacetime symmetries, and in Kerr those notions admit negative energy at infinity outside the horizon. This undermines naive intuition about positivity and stability and motivates phenomena like the Penrose process and wave superradiance. Rather than predicting amplification, the toy stress-tests the inequality that defines the superradiant window, $0<\omega<m\Omega_H$, showing how it depends only on horizon properties and mode labels, not on detailed field dynamics.

The JSON output should be read as a catalog of logical conditions rather than physical outcomes. Flags such as `in_ergoregion_gtt_positive` indicate where negative-energy-at-infinity states are kinematically allowed, while the superradiance grids simply mark whether sampled frequencies satisfy the inequality relative to $m\Omega_H$. Large regions marked “superradiant” do not imply large amplification, instability, or astrophysical relevance; they only confirm that the inequality is satisfied. Interpreting the results means checking consistency between the metric sign, the horizon parameters, and the inequality, and resisting the temptation to over-interpret numerical values as predictions beyond the illustrative equations that define them.
