## Toy 016 — Gödel Spacetime and the Onset of Closed Timelike Curves

This toy illustrates how closed timelike curves (CTCs) arise in the Gödel spacetime by tracking the sign of a single metric component associated with circular motion. The physical setup is a rotating cosmological solution of general relativity written in coordinates $(t,r,\phi,z)$, where the angular coordinate $\phi$ is periodic. The quantity of interest is the norm of a closed loop at fixed $(t,r,z)$ as $\phi$ runs from $0$ to $2\pi$, which is controlled by the metric component $g_{\phi\phi}(r)=D(r)^2-H(r)^2$; when this quantity becomes negative, the closed angular loop becomes timelike.

The toy exists to expose a conceptual pressure point in general relativity: the theory admits exact solutions with global violations of chronology that are not removable by coordinate choices. Gödel spacetime provides a clean stress test because the transition to CTCs occurs through a simple, local diagnostic rather than a subtle global construction. In particular, there is a sharply defined radius $r_c$ given by $r_c=(2/\Omega)\,\mathrm{asinh}(1)$ at which $g_{\phi\phi}$ changes sign, demonstrating that causal pathologies can appear abruptly and geometrically, without signaling a breakdown of the field equations themselves.

The JSON output should be read as a radial scan across this chronology horizon. For each sampled radius, the key indicators are the value of $g_{\phi\phi}$ and the derived interval $ds^2=g_{\phi\phi}(2\pi)^2$ for a closed $\phi$-loop: positive values indicate spacelike loops, while negative values flag closed timelike curves. The reported horizon radius $r_c$ provides a reference for where the sign flip is expected, and the rapid growth in the magnitude of negative $ds^2$ at larger $r$ reflects how strongly timelike the loops become. These numbers should not be over-interpreted as dynamical predictions or measures of stability; they simply encode how the algebraic condition $g_{\phi\phi}<0$ manifests in the sampled geometry and connect the raw JSON values back to the defining metric relations.

## Toy 017 — Alcubierre Warp Bubble: On-Axis Expansion and Energy-Condition Proxies

This toy illustrates a one-dimensional slice through the Alcubierre warp-bubble geometry, focusing on how a prescribed “shape function” creates a moving region of nearly flat spacetime surrounded by a narrow wall. The physical setup is an engineered metric with a bubble translating along the $x$-axis at coordinate speed $v$, while observers sample quantities along the axis $y=z=0$ at a fixed time. The central quantity of interest is how the shape function $f(r_s)$ and its spatial gradient organize expansion and contraction along the axis, as encoded in the metric $ds^2=-dt^2+(dx-v f(r_s)dt)^2+dy^2+dz^2$, where $r_s=|x-vt|$ measures distance from the bubble center.

The toy exists to stress-test a well-known limitation of warp-drive constructions rather than to make a physical prediction. Alcubierre-type metrics separate local notions of motion from global transport, but they are known to require exotic stress-energy that violates standard energy conditions. This code exposes that issue by isolating where gradients of the shaping function become large, since those gradients control the appearance of negative-energy contributions in full treatments. The key heuristic is that such contributions scale like $-v^2|\nabla f|^2$, so the toy is designed to demonstrate where and how strongly this problematic scaling appears, not to compute an actual stress-energy tensor.

The JSON results should be read as a spatial scan across the bubble, with each sample point reporting $f(r_s)$, its on-axis derivative $df/dx$, and two derived proxies. Peaks in $|df/dx|$ identify the bubble wall, while near-zero values indicate the interior and exterior; the sign of $\theta_{\mathrm{proxy}}=v\,df/dx$ shows local expansion or contraction along the axis, and the magnitude of $\mathrm{nec\_proxy}=-v^2(df/dx)^2$ flags where energy-condition violations would be strongest in a full calculation. These numbers are meaningful only in a relative, diagnostic sense: their symmetry about the bubble center and their localization at the wall are the trends to notice, while their absolute values, null curvature entries, and the proxy labels should not be over-interpreted as direct physical observables or as evidence for realizable warp propulsion.

## Toy 018 — Traversable Wormhole Stress–Energy and NEC Violation

This toy evaluates the stress–energy tensor implied by a canonical Morris–Thorne traversable wormhole metric, using a static orthonormal frame so the output reads directly as an energy density $\rho(r)$, a radial pressure $p_r(r)$, and a transverse pressure $p_t(r)$ as functions of areal radius $r$ with throat scale $r_0$. The geometric setup is a static, spherically symmetric spacetime with redshift function $\Phi(r)=0$ (no horizon) and shape function $b(r)=r_0^2/r$, and the quantity of interest is the null energy condition (NEC) diagnostic along radial null directions, $ \rho(r)+p_r(r) $. In this specific model the toy exposes the exact radial NEC combination $\rho+p_r=-(1/4\pi)\,r_0^2/r^4$, which is negative for all $r\ge r_0$.

The toy exists to stress-test intuition about “exotic matter” requirements by showing the bookkeeping explicitly: once $\Phi(r)$ and $b(r)$ are chosen, Einstein’s equation fixes $T_{\mu\nu}$, and energy-condition statements become concrete inequalities rather than slogans. The conceptual failure mode it illustrates is treating traversability as a purely geometric feature while forgetting that the supporting matter content is not optional and can violate standard energy conditions everywhere, even in an otherwise tame-looking static spacetime. As a limitation test rather than a physical prediction, it emphasizes that radial NEC satisfaction reduces to the sign of $\rho+p_r$ (here always negative), so any attempt to interpret the geometry as supported by ordinary classical matter runs into a clear diagnostic contradiction.

To interpret the JSON, focus on `sample_points[*].local_observables.stress_energy_orthonormal_static` for $(\rho, p_r, p_t)$ and on `energy_conditions.NEC_radial_rho_plus_p_r` for the key stress-test signal; the important trend is that the magnitudes fall rapidly with radius (scaling like $r^{-4}$) while the sign of `NEC_radial_rho_plus_p_r` remains negative at every sampled $r$. Near the throat (`r` close to `r0`), the toy also reports geometric anchors such as `one_minus_b_over_r` approaching zero and the embedding-related quantities (`proper_distance_from_throat_l`, `embedding_equatorial_z`, `embedding_slope_dz_dr_abs`) reflecting the familiar flared shape, but these are context, not evidence of any realizable material. What should not be over-interpreted is any claim about microphysics, stability, or observable astrophysical signatures: curvature invariants are intentionally left null, and the numbers represent the exact $T_{\mu\nu}$ required by the chosen ansatz; conceptually, read the NEC field `NEC_radial_rho_plus_p_r` as the JSON incarnation of $\rho+p_r$, and use the relative sizes of $\rho$, $p_r$, and $p_t$ to understand how the required “exoticity” is distributed without treating it as a prediction about real matter.

## Toy 019 — Raychaudhuri Focusing of Null Congruences

This toy integrates the null Raychaudhuri equation for a simple, idealized bundle of light rays (a null congruence) and tracks how its expansion evolves along an affine parameter $\lambda$. The physical setup assumes a hypersurface-orthogonal congruence with vanishing shear and twist, so the only drivers of the expansion $\theta$ are its own nonlinear self-interaction and a prescribed curvature term $R_{ab}k^a k^b$ along the rays. In this limit the evolution is governed by the single ordinary differential equation $$\frac{d\theta}{d\lambda} = -\tfrac{1}{2}\theta^2 - R_{ab}k^a k^b,$$ and an auxiliary “area proxy” $A(\lambda)$ defined by $d(\ln A)/d\lambda=\theta$ provides intuition for caustic formation when the congruence focuses.

The toy exists to stress-test the logical core of the focusing theorems rather than to model a realistic spacetime. In classical general relativity, assuming the null energy condition implies $R_{ab}k^a k^b \ge 0$, which guarantees that initially converging null congruences focus in finite affine parameter; violating this sign assumption is exactly where the usual singularity arguments fail. By allowing $R_{ab}k^a k^b$ to be positive, zero, or negative by construction, the toy exposes how focusing, delayed focusing, or defocusing arises purely from the sign structure of the Raychaudhuri equation, not from any detailed metric solution. Even in the vacuum case $R_{ab}k^a k^b=0$, the equation predicts finite-$\lambda$ blow-up for $\theta_0<0$, with an analytic estimate $\lambda_*=-2/\theta_0$, illustrating how little input is required for the focusing logic to activate.

The JSON output should be read as a record of this ODE experiment rather than as spacetime data. The `sample_points` list reports $\lambda$, the instantaneous expansion $\theta$, the chosen curvature input $R_{ab}k^a k^b$, and the area proxy $A$, while the `observables` block summarizes whether a focusing threshold was reached and at what affine parameter this occurred. The key trend to watch is the monotonic decrease of $\theta$ and the corresponding collapse of $A$ toward zero when focusing occurs; the precise numerical value of the threshold-crossing $\theta$ or the detailed late-time behavior beyond it should not be over-interpreted. All quantities connect back conceptually to the Raychaudhuri equation and the definition of $A$: large negative $\theta$ signals the breakdown of the congruence description (a caustic), not a physical divergence of curvature or a prediction of a real singularity.

## Toy 020 — Reissner–Nordström: charge, extremality, and inner horizon diagnostics

This toy evaluates the Reissner–Nordström (RN) electrovac spacetime for a chosen mass $M$ and charge $Q$, sampling a set of radii $r$ and exporting simple horizon and invariant diagnostics. The physical setup is a static, spherically symmetric charged black hole (or its non–black-hole continuation) written in Schwarzschild-like coordinates with metric function $f(r)=1-2M/r+Q^2/r^2$, where the sign and zeros of $f(r)$ organize the coordinate-time behavior of radial lightcones and indicate where horizons occur. The main quantities of interest are the horizon radii (when they exist), the outer-horizon surface gravity and potential, and curvature/field invariants that remain meaningful even when coordinates behave badly.

The toy exists to illustrate how adding charge changes causal structure and exposes limitations of common diagnostics, especially near the inner (Cauchy) horizon and the extremal boundary. In RN, the horizon locations depend on the discriminant $M^2-Q^2$: for $|Q|\le M$ there are two horizons at $r_\pm=M\pm\sqrt{M^2-Q^2}$, which merge in the extremal limit and disappear entirely for $|Q|>M$ (a “naked” regime that stresses cosmic-censorship intuitions rather than predicting nature). It is a stress test because several familiar indicators (notably the coordinate slope $dr/dt=\pm f(r)$) can suggest dramatic behavior at horizons that is partly coordinate-dependence, while invariant scalars (e.g., curvature) isolate what is genuinely diverging from what is merely a coordinate degeneracy.

To interpret the JSON, start with `observables.horizons`: `kind` classifies the regime, `r_plus` and `r_minus` give the outer/inner horizon radii when $|Q|\le M$, and `surface_gravity_kappa_plus` and `horizon_potential_PhiH` summarize how “close to extremal” the configuration is (here $M=1$, $Q=0.6$ gives $r_+=1.8$, $r_-=0.2$, $\kappa_+=0.2469$, $\Phi_H=0.3333$). In `sample_points`, trends with radius matter: the curvature invariant `kretschmann` and EM scalars such as `F_abF^ab` and `rho_em_static` should grow sharply as $r$ decreases (reflecting the $r^{-8}$ and $r^{-4}$ scalings), while `metric_function.f(r)` changing sign indicates passage into the between-horizons region, and `region` labels that classification. What should not be over-interpreted is the magnitude or sign of `radial_null_cone_dr_dt` as a physical speed—by construction it is the coordinate slope $dr/dt=\pm f(r)$ and “degenerates” when $f(r)=0$—so use it only as a pointer to where the sampled radii sit relative to the horizon equation $f(r)=0$, and connect the exported numbers back to the defining relations for $f(r)$, $r_\pm$, and the invariant scalings rather than treating them as direct observables.
