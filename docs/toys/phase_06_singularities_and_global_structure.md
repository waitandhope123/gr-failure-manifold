## Toy 028 — Proper-time countdown to the Schwarzschild singularity

This toy computes how much *proper time* $\tau$ remains for a freely falling observer to reach the Schwarzschild singularity at $r=0$ while falling radially from rest at infinity in a Schwarzschild spacetime (with mass parameter $M$ and units $G=c=1$). The quantity of interest is the remaining wristwatch time as a function of radius $r$, using the infall law $dr/d\tau=-\sqrt{2M/r}$ to define a “countdown” along the worldline. The central anchor is the closed-form remaining proper time $$\tau(r\to 0)=\frac{2}{3}\frac{r^{3/2}}{\sqrt{2M}}$$ which is finite for any finite $r$.

The toy exists to stress-test intuition about “approaching” black hole singularities by separating physically meaningful time from coordinate artifacts. It demonstrates a limitation of Schwarzschild coordinate time $t$: exterior expressions like $dt/dr=\sqrt{r/(2M)}/(1-2M/r)$ become ill-behaved near the horizon and are not used in the interior, even though the infaller’s proper-time evolution stays smooth and the remaining $\tau$ continues to decrease. The point is not to predict what happens at $r=0$, but to expose how relying on $t$ can suggest a “freeze” or ambiguity at $r=2M$ while the proper-time clock provides an unambiguous monotone countdown.

To interpret the JSON, read each entry in `sample_points` as a radius snapshot: `local_observables.proper_time_remaining_to_singularity_from_r` is the countdown $\tau(r\to 0)$, and `local_observables.proper_time_from_r0_to_r` is the elapsed proper time from the chosen reference start radius $r_0$ (given in `parameters.reference_start_radius_r0`) down to $r$, conceptually matching $\Delta\tau(r_0\to r)=\frac{2}{3}(r_0^{3/2}-r^{3/2})/\sqrt{2M}$. The sign and magnitude trends that matter are that `dr_dtau` is negative (inward motion) and that the remaining proper time shrinks roughly like $r^{3/2}$ as $r$ decreases; by contrast `dt_dr_exterior_only` growing large near the horizon (and becoming `null` inside) should *not* be over-interpreted as physical slowing, only as a coordinate limitation tied to the denominator $1-2M/r$. Curvature scalars like `curvature_invariants.kretschmann` connect back to radius (here $\propto M^2/r^6$) and can be used to contextualize “how strong” the field is at a given $r$, but the toy is illustrating coordinate-versus-proper-time behavior rather than asserting any detailed physical outcome at the singularity.

## Toy 029 — Kruskal Extension and Horizon Regularity

This toy maps a Schwarzschild black hole spacetime (mass $M$ in units $G=c=1$) from Schwarzschild coordinates $(t,r)$ into Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates $(T,X)$ to demonstrate that the event horizon at $r=2M$ is not a physical singularity. It constructs the tortoise coordinate $r_\ast$ and null coordinates $u=t-r_\ast$, $v=t+r_\ast$, then exponentiates them to obtain $(U,V)$ and finally $(T,X)$, highlighting how the same geometric point can look pathological or well-behaved depending on the coordinate choice. The quantity of interest is the radial–temporal metric prefactor in Kruskal form, $A(r)=(32M^3/r)\exp(-r/(2M))$, which multiplies $(-dT^2+dX^2)$ and stays finite at the horizon.

The toy exists as a stress test for coordinate dependence: it exposes the common failure mode of treating a coordinate singularity as a physical one. In Schwarzschild coordinates the factor $f(r)=1-2M/r$ goes to zero at $r=2M$, which can make expressions involving $1/f(r)$ appear to diverge and can mislead debugging or interpretation if one forgets that this is a chart artifact. By contrast, the Kruskal construction is designed so that the horizon corresponds to a regular null surface where the metric’s overall scale remains finite, so the toy demonstrates that “singular-looking” behavior in $(t,r)$ should be checked against invariant diagnostics and/or a regular coordinate system before drawing conclusions.

To interpret the JSON, read each `sample_points[i]` as an evaluation at a chosen radius `r` (with `t0` setting the time slice) and compare three linked blocks: `local_observables.schwarzschild_f` (the Schwarzschild coordinate factor), `local_observables.kruskal_prefactor_A` along with `kruskal_metric_radial_temporal.g_TT=-A` and `g_XX=+A`, and `curvature_invariants.kretschmann` as an invariant scale check. Near `observables.horizon_2M` you should see `schwarzschild_f` approach $0$ while `kruskal_prefactor_A` stays of order unity (specifically `observables.kruskal_prefactor_at_horizon` matches $A(2M)=16M^2/e$), signaling regularity of the Kruskal radial–temporal metric; you should also see the Kretschmann scalar remain finite and grow only as $r$ decreases, consistent with $K=48M^2/r^6$ rather than any new divergence at the horizon. Do not over-interpret the absolute values of `U,V,T,X` on the `region: "horizon (r=2M)"` entry where those fields are null (the mapping is limit-dependent exactly at $r=2M$), and do not treat the coordinate magnitudes (e.g. large `X` at large $r$) as physical observables; instead, use the signs/trends—$f(r)$ changing sign across the horizon and $A(r)$ remaining finite—to connect the JSON back to the coordinate-change definitions and the metric prefactor equation conceptually.

## Toy 030 — Schwarzschild Horizon Scaling as a Global Thermodynamic Proxy

This toy computes simple horizon-based quantities for a Schwarzschild black hole in geometric units ($G=c=1$) as you vary the mass $M$ (the only parameter). The physical setup is “a static, spherically symmetric black hole,” and the quantities of interest are the horizon radius, area, surface gravity, and two semiclassical proxy diagnostics often associated with thermodynamics: a temperature proxy and an entropy proxy. As an orienting anchor, the horizon area follows $$A = 16\pi M^2$$ which already signals the key scaling behavior the toy is designed to expose.

The toy exists to stress-test a common conceptual pitfall: treating horizon-thermodynamic-looking relations as if they correspond to a unique, localizable energy or entropy density in the spacetime. It illustrates that the most salient quantities here—$A$ and the surface gravity $\kappa$ (and anything built from them, like the temperature proxy $T$)—encode global/horizon properties rather than something you can attribute unambiguously to local matter content or a local gravitational “stuff.” A compact way to frame the limitation is the inverse scaling $$T \propto \kappa \propto \frac{1}{M}$$ which is a useful diagnostic relation in this toy but should be read as a stress test of interpretive habits, not as a physical prediction extracted from local dynamics.

To interpret the JSON, treat each entry in `sample_points` as an independent mass point: `coordinates.M` is the input $M$, and `local_observables` reports `horizon_radius` ($r_h$), `horizon_area` ($A$), `surface_gravity_kappa` ($\kappa$), `hawking_temperature_proxy` ($T$), and `entropy_proxy` ($S$). The most important trends are the constancy of the dimensionless scaling checks in `scalings`—`A_over_M2` and `S_over_M2` should remain constant across $M$ (confirming $A\sim M^2$ and $S\sim M^2$), while `T_times_M` should remain constant (confirming $T\sim 1/M$); by contrast, `curvature_invariants.kretschmann_at_horizon` should decrease rapidly with increasing $M$, indicating that larger holes have “gentler” curvature at the horizon. Do not over-interpret the absolute magnitudes of `hawking_temperature_proxy` or `entropy_proxy` as thermodynamic truth in isolation (the toy explicitly treats them as proxies), and do not read any of these numbers as implying a local energy/entropy density; instead, connect them conceptually back to the same horizon formulas (e.g., $A=16\pi M^2$ and $S=A/4$) whose scalings the JSON is designed to make obvious.

## Toy 031 — Global hyperbolicity and Cauchy development

This toy compares causal “predictability from initial data” in two simple 2D spacetimes: ordinary Minkowski space and Misner space. You specify an initial spacelike slice at $t=t_0$ with finite support $|x|\le L$ (here $t_0=0$ and $L=5$), then ask whether a later (or earlier) point lies in the region whose behavior is fixed by that slice. In Minkowski this reduces to a lightcone check: points satisfying $|t-t_0|\le L$ are flagged as determined by the initial slice, while points outside that band are not.

The toy exists to stress-test an assumption that often sneaks into GR-flavored code: that “initial data + equations of motion” automatically implies a unique evolution everywhere. General relativity does not guarantee global hyperbolicity, and Misner spacetime is a clean counterexample where determinism fails without any curvature blow-up. The specific failure mode illustrated is the appearance of a Cauchy horizon: beyond it, the same initial slice admits multiple inequivalent extensions, so “the” future is not unique even though local invariants stay benign; in this toy that boundary is captured by the sign of $u v$, with $u v>0$ treated as beyond the horizon (non-unique evolution) and $u v<0$ as within the uniquely determined region.

Interpret the JSON by reading each `sample_points[i]` as a local diagnostic at a coordinate location, not as a global solution. In Minkowski entries, `local_observables.domain_of_dependence` and `causal_structure.predictable_from_initial_slice` should track the inequality $|t-t_0|\le L$ (e.g., the point at $t=6$ flips to `false` because it lies outside the slice’s causal reach), while curvature invariants remain zero throughout. In Misner entries, `local_observables.unique_cauchy_evolution` (and the mirrored `predictable_from_initial_slice`) flips from `true` to `false` when moving from $u v<0$ to $u v>0$, and `cauchy_horizon_crossed` turns on accordingly; the trend to watch is this sign change, not the absolute coordinate magnitudes. Do not over-interpret the booleans as probabilities, dynamics, or a claim about what “really happens” physically—these flags only encode the conceptual link between “inside/outside the domain fixed by initial data” and the toy’s horizon criterion, i.e., how the JSON’s predictability fields map back to the inequalities $|t-t_0|\le L$ and $u v<0$.

## Toy 032 — Mass inflation proxy near the Reissner–Nordström inner horizon

This toy illustrates how a charged, non-rotating black hole spacetime (Reissner–Nordström with $|Q|<M$ in units $G=c=1$) can exhibit dramatic amplification of small disturbances near its inner (Cauchy) horizon. The setup computes the outer and inner horizon radii $r_\pm = M \pm \sqrt{M^2 - Q^2}$ and then tracks an effective interior mass parameter as a function of advanced time $v$, treating that mass as the quantity of interest. The core proxy is the ansatz $m_{\mathrm{eff}}(v)=M + A(\exp(\kappa_- v)-1)$, where $A$ is a tiny perturbation amplitude and $\kappa_-$ is the inner-horizon surface gravity magnitude.

The toy exists to expose a limitation of the idealized exact Reissner–Nordström solution: the inner horizon is a boundary where predictability can fail because infalling and outgoing perturbations become exponentially blue-shifted. Rather than predicting a physical interior for an astrophysical black hole, it stress-tests how quickly an instability can dominate diagnostics when the growth rate is set by $\kappa_-=(r_+-r_-)/(2r_-^2)$ (with $\kappa_-$ named here as the inner-horizon surface gravity magnitude used as a growth rate). In this model, “instability” means that even when $A$ is extremely small, any quantity that depends strongly on $m_{\mathrm{eff}}$ can be driven to huge values over modest increases in $v$, demonstrating a conceptual failure mode for naive interior extrapolations.

To interpret the JSON, focus on how values change with `v_advanced` in `sample_points`: the `blueshift_factor_exp(kappa_minus*v)` should grow like $\exp(\kappa_- v)$, the `effective_mass_m_eff` should track it linearly through the ansatz, and `kretschmann_proxy` should scale roughly like $m_{\mathrm{eff}}^2$ at fixed `r_scale = r_minus`. The summary’s `growth_factor_m_eff_over_interval` and `growth_factor_K_proxy_over_interval` quantify this compounding effect, while `kappa_minus`, `r_minus`, and `r_plus` tell you whether the chosen $(M,Q)$ makes the inner horizon “strong” (larger $\kappa_-$ means faster growth). Do not over-interpret the absolute magnitude of `kretschmann_proxy` as a true curvature invariant of perturbed Einstein–Maxwell dynamics: it is explicitly a proxy $K_{\mathrm{proxy}}=48\,m_{\mathrm{eff}}^2/r_-^6$ (with $r_-$ named as the inner-horizon radius used as the fixed length scale), so the meaningful content is the trend and scaling with $v$ and with $A$, not a literal prediction of the RN interior curvature.

## Toy 033 — Backreaction proxy and test-particle breakdown

This toy illustrates how even a small gravitating probe can modify geometric and observable quantities when the spacetime itself responds to mass. The setup is a Schwarzschild spacetime with background mass $M$, supplemented by a proxy “backreacted” spacetime in which the mass parameter is replaced by $M_\mathrm{total}=M(1+\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon=m/M$ represents the probe-to-background mass ratio. The quantities of interest are invariant radii (horizon, photon sphere, ISCO), the gravitational redshift for static observers, and a curvature scalar, all evaluated at fixed coordinate radii to expose how they shift as $\epsilon$ is increased.

The toy exists to expose a limitation of the test-particle approximation rather than to make a physical prediction. In many relativistic calculations one assumes $m/M\to 0$ so that the probe follows geodesics of a fixed background, but general relativity is nonlinear and this assumption hides an ambiguity: even tiny $\epsilon$ changes the geometry itself. By enforcing a simple scaling $M\to M(1+\epsilon)$, the toy acts as a stress test showing that mass-scaled observables shift at order $\epsilon$, making the approximation fragile whenever required accuracy competes with this scaling.

The JSON results should be read as a catalog of how background and proxy quantities compare at the same coordinate radius and $\epsilon$. Fractional shifts of the horizon, photon sphere, and ISCO radii track $\epsilon$ exactly, while relative changes in the lapse $\alpha(r)=\sqrt{1-2M/r}$ and in the Kretschmann scalar reflect how local observables respond to the mass rescaling. Trends with increasing $\epsilon$—such as growing redshift changes or regions where the proxy horizon overtakes a sampling radius—signal breakdown of the test-particle picture, but the absolute numerical values should not be over-interpreted as physical self-force effects; they merely connect the reported JSON fields back to the underlying mass-scaled equations and illustrate sensitivity, not dynamics.
