## Toy 086 — Hyperbolicity and Well-Posedness Failure

This toy compares two linear 1D first-order evolution systems of the form $u_t = A\,u_x$, meant to mimic how a GR evolution *formulation* (rather than curvature or matter) can control whether time evolution behaves sensibly. The physical setup is a plane-wave probe $u \sim e^{i k x}$, which turns the PDE into an ODE with solution operator $u(t) = \exp(i k A t)\,u(0)$, and the quantity of interest is the spectral operator norm $\|\exp(i k A t)\|$ as a measure of Fourier-mode amplification.

The toy exists to expose a formulation-level failure mode: having real characteristic speeds is not enough—if the principal symbol is not diagonalizable, the system can be only weakly hyperbolic and the initial value problem becomes ill-posed in the high-frequency limit. Concretely, the Jordan-block choice of $A$ yields an evolution operator with polynomial-in-$k$ growth, $\|\exp(i k A t)\| \sim 1 + |k|t$, so refining resolution (accessing larger $k$) makes arbitrarily small-scale perturbations blow up; this is a stress test of well-posedness, not a physical prediction of instability.

To interpret the JSON, focus on `local_observables.fourier_mode_diagnostics.propagator_opnorm` at fixed time `t` as `k` increases, and especially on the `observables.resolution_proxy` entries where `k_max_pi_over_dx` implements the proxy $k_{\max}\sim \pi/dx$. In the strongly hyperbolic formulation the norm stays near 1 across sampled $(k,t)$ and across decreasing `dx`, indicating bounded amplification consistent with a well-posed evolution, while in the weakly hyperbolic Jordan case the norm grows roughly linearly with both `t` and `k_max_pi_over_dx` (e.g., it becomes very large at small `dx` and moderate `t`), signaling resolution-worsening behavior. Do not over-interpret the absolute numbers as “physical growth rates” or as evidence of any GR spacetime instability; instead read them as how the measured amplification norm connects back to $\|\exp(i k A t)\|$ and the distinction between diagonalizable (strongly hyperbolic) versus defective (weakly hyperbolic) principal parts.

## Toy 087 — Cosmic string: topology and holonomy without local curvature

This toy illustrates a spacetime describing an idealized straight cosmic string, where the geometry is locally flat everywhere away from the string but globally nontrivial. The physical setup is a static, infinitesimally thin line source along the $z$-axis with line density $\mu$, producing a conical geometry rather than ordinary flat space. The quantity of interest is how global features such as circumference, enclosed area, and parallel transport differ from flat expectations even though local curvature scalars vanish, as encoded by the metric factor $\alpha = 1 - 4\mu$ and the associated deficit angle $$\delta = 2\pi(1-\alpha)=8\pi\mu.$$

The toy exists to expose a limitation of relying solely on local curvature diagnostics when reasoning about spacetime structure. It stress-tests the intuition that “flat curvature means trivial geometry” by providing a counterexample in which all sampled curvature invariants are zero for $r>0$, yet observable global effects persist. This is not a physical prediction exercise but a conceptual probe: it demonstrates that topology and holonomy can encode information invisible to local tensors, and that distributional sources at idealized locations can invalidate naive extrapolations from smooth curvature data.

The JSON results should be read by comparing flat-space expectations with their conical counterparts at different radii. Ratios such as $C/C_0$ and $A/A_0$ staying constant at $\alpha=0.8$ show that circumferences and areas are uniformly reduced, while the curvature invariants remaining zero confirm local flatness outside the axis. The nonzero holonomy and lensing angles equal to $\delta$ signal global effects that do not decay with radius. These numbers should not be over-interpreted as forces or tidal fields; they encode geometric identification rather than local gravity. Conceptually, the reported values connect back to the equations by showing how the same $\alpha$ controlling $C(r)=2\pi\alpha r$ also fixes the global rotation accumulated around the string.

## Toy 088 — Classical chaos without singularities (chaotic geodesics proxy)

Toy 088 evolves a 2D point particle in a smooth, time-independent two-center attractive potential and tracks how two nearly identical initial conditions diverge over time, as a stand-in for the qualitative complexity of multi-center geodesic motion. The physical setup is a test mass moving in $(x,y)$ under an effective potential $\Phi(x,y)=-M_1/r_1-M_2/r_2$ (with $r_{1,2}$ the distances to two fixed centers), using the Hamiltonian $H=\tfrac12(v_x^2+v_y^2)+\Phi(x,y)$ as the quantity anchoring “how energetic” the trajectory is. Alongside the primary trajectory (“A”), the toy integrates a copy (“B”) whose initial $y$ coordinate is offset by a tiny $\delta_0$, and it records the separation in phase space to make unpredictability visible without invoking horizons or singularities.

This toy exists to illustrate a specific failure mode for predictability diagnostics: deterministic equations can yield practically irreproducible outcomes even when the model is smooth and no geometric pathology is being sampled. The conceptual issue it stresses is sensitivity to initial conditions, quantified by a finite-time Lyapunov proxy $\lambda(t)\approx (1/t)\ln(\|\delta(t)\|/\|\delta(0)\|)$ where $\delta(t)$ is the phase-space difference between trajectories A and B and $\|\cdot\|$ is an $L2$ norm over $(x,y,v_x,v_y)$. The output is therefore a limitation/stress test—“chaos detected” means exponential separation was observed under the toy’s criteria, not that any real spacetime must behave this way, and curvature invariants are explicitly exported as `null` to avoid implying a GR geometry was actually evolved.

To interpret the JSON, start with `observables.summary`: `separation_efolds_ln_dend_over_d0` reports $\ln(\|\delta(t_{\mathrm{end}})\|/\|\delta(0)\|)$, so large positive values mean many e-folds of separation growth; `lambda_proxy_last` and `lambda_proxy_max_over_samples` summarize the same idea as an effective rate $\lambda(t)$, where positive values matter primarily by sign and order of magnitude rather than any “universal” number. The `sample_points` list shows the time series: `separation_phase_space_L2` should grow rapidly early if the run is chaotic by this proxy, while `finite_time_lyapunov_proxy` typically decays toward a smaller late-time value as $t$ increases because it is normalized by $1/t$ even if the separation keeps increasing. Do not over-interpret absolute energies or drifts here: `energy_drift_abs_A/B` reflects numerical integration quality and the run can also “escape” (`escaped`, `escape_time`) so late-time growth may reflect continuing divergence on an outgoing trajectory; instead, treat the reported separation growth and $\lambda(t)$ as the diagnostic, conceptually tied back to the proxy equation by reading the JSON’s $\|\delta(t)\|$ values as the input to the logarithm and the reported $\lambda$ values as the time-normalized slope.

## Toy 089 — Birkhoff Boundary via Spherically Symmetric Radiation

This toy illustrates a spherically symmetric spacetime whose exterior geometry can evolve in time because it contains outgoing radiation rather than vacuum. The physical setup is an exact solution of general relativity known as the outgoing Vaidya spacetime, where the metric depends on a retarded time coordinate $u$ through a mass function $M(u)$. The quantity of interest is how curvature, horizons, and stress–energy behave when spherical symmetry is preserved but the mass changes, with the metric coefficient schematically given by $f(u,r)=1-2M(u)/r$ for areal radius $r$.

The toy exists to expose a precise boundary of Birkhoff’s theorem by dropping one of its hypotheses. Birkhoff’s theorem guarantees that any spherically symmetric vacuum region must be static, but it says nothing once the vacuum assumption is relaxed. Here the exterior contains null dust, characterized by a nonzero stress–energy component $T_{uu}\propto -\,dM/du$, so the spacetime remains spherically symmetric while becoming explicitly time-dependent. This is not a prediction of astrophysical behavior but a stress test of a theorem: it demonstrates how the conclusion fails when the condition $T_{ab}=0$ is no longer satisfied.

The JSON results should be read as pointwise diagnostics sampled at various $(u,r)$. The key trends are the sign and magnitude of $dM/du$, which control whether the exterior is time-dependent, and the associated stress–energy proxy $T_{uu}$, which is nonzero everywhere in these samples and therefore flags that Birkhoff’s theorem does not apply. Curvature scalars such as the Kretschmann invariant track the changing mass through their dependence on $M(u)$, while the apparent-horizon proxy $r_{\mathrm{AH}}(u)=2M(u)$ shows how the horizon scale moves in time. These values should not be over-interpreted as statements about event horizons or global dynamics; they are local indicators meant to be connected conceptually back to the defining relations for $M(u)$, $f(u,r)$, and $T_{uu}$ rather than treated as complete physical observables.

## Toy 090 — Hyperbolicity and Well-Posedness via a Principal Symbol

This toy illustrates how the well-posedness of an initial value problem can fail at the level of partial differential equations by examining a minimal first-order linear system $U_t + A(p) U_x = 0$. The physical setup is intentionally abstract: a one-dimensional field $U$ evolves under a parameter-dependent matrix $A(p)$ that stands in for the principal symbol of a more complicated system. By inserting a Fourier mode $U \sim e^{i k x}$, the evolution reduces to $U_t = - i k A(p) U$, making the eigenvalues of $A(p)$ the quantities of interest because they control characteristic speeds and potential growth of high-frequency modes.

The toy exists to expose a conceptual failure mode rather than to model any physical dynamics: some formulations or gauge choices can lose strong hyperbolicity even when the underlying equations appear reasonable. This is a stress test for formulation health, showing how repeated or complex eigenvalues undermine uniform control of solutions as $|k|$ grows. In this setting, the eigenvalues $\lambda = 1 \pm \sqrt{p}$ separate three regimes—distinct real values, a defective repeated value, or a complex pair—demonstrating how an initial value problem can transition from strongly hyperbolic to weakly hyperbolic or outright ill-posed without invoking curvature, coordinates, or physical sources.

The JSON output should be read as a diagnostic table rather than a prediction: each sample point lists the eigenvalues of $A(p)$, a regime classification, and a proxy growth rate defined as $|k| \max(|\mathrm{Im}(\lambda)|)$. Trends that matter are the appearance of nonzero imaginary parts (signaling exponential growth that scales with $|k|$) and the loss of diagonalizability at $p=0$, while the exact numerical values of growth rates or eigenvalue magnitudes should not be over-interpreted. The summary fractions over the sampled $p$ grid simply count how often each regime appears, tying the JSON fields back to the eigenvalue structure of $A(p)$ and the Fourier-mode evolution equation in a purely illustrative way.
