# Getting Started with the GR Toy Lab

**A guide to understanding and using the documentation.**

## What Are These "Toys"?

Each toy is a **minimal computational pressure test** designed to:
1. Isolate a specific assumption or limit of General Relativity
2. Make the failure observable and reproducible
3. Provide machine-readable diagnostics (JSON output)

**They are NOT:**
- Full physics simulations
- Claims that GR is wrong
- Quantum gravity proposals
- Production numerical relativity codes

**They ARE:**
- Diagnostic tests showing where GR becomes ill-defined
- Educational tools for understanding GR's boundaries
- Research frameworks for testing new theories
- Reproducible demonstrations of known limitations

## How to Navigate the Documentation

### For Beginners (Learning GR's Limits)

**Recommended path:**

1. **Start with Phase I** — [Foundations & Baselines](../toys/phase_01_foundations_and_baselines.md)
   - Toy 001: Learn what's coordinate artifact vs real curvature
   - Toy 002: See how Newtonian gravity relates to GR
   - Toy 003: Understand gravitational waves
   - Toy 004: Explore cosmological expansion

2. **Move to Phase II** — [Horizons & Coordinates](../toys/phase_02_horizons_and_coordinates.md)
   - Understand why horizons aren't singularities
   - See how coordinate choices affect observations
   - Learn about unstable orbits

3. **Continue sequentially through phases**
   - Each phase builds on concepts from previous ones
   - Complexity increases gradually
   - By Phase XIII you'll understand quantum observers and emergent causality

### For Researchers (Specific Topics)

**Use the index files:**

- **[By Toy Number](../indices/by_toy_number.md)** — Sequential list if you want completeness
- **[By Spacetime](../indices/by_spacetime.md)** — Find all Schwarzschild, Kerr, FLRW, etc. toys
- **[By Failure Mode](../indices/by_failure_mode.md)** — Energy issues, observer disagreement, etc.
- **[Quick Reference](../indices/quick_reference.md)** — Scan the full table

**Jump directly to relevant phases:**
- Studying black holes? → **Phases II, III, VI**
- Quantum effects? → **Phases X, XI**
- Numerical methods? → **Phase VIII**
- Holography/emergence? → **Phase XII**

## Understanding a Toy Description

Each toy follows a standard structure:

### 1. **Title & Overview**
```
Toy 001 — Schwarzschild Baseline: Curvature vs Coordinate Pathologies

This toy evaluates the exact Schwarzschild vacuum spacetime...
```
Tells you what's being modeled and in what context.

### 2. **Physical Setup**
```
The physical setup is a static, spherically symmetric exterior geometry...
```
Describes the system, parameters, and key quantities of interest.

### 3. **Stress Test Purpose**
```
The toy exists to stress-test the difference between geometric, 
frame-invariant statements and coordinate-dependent statements...
```
Explains what conceptual trap or limitation is being exposed.

### 4. **JSON Interpretation Guide**
```
To interpret the JSON, read each entry in `sample_points` as a 
radius-local diagnostic packet: `curvature_invariants.kretschmann` 
should increase strongly as r decreases...
```
Tells you exactly how to read the output fields and what to look for.

### 5. **Over-Interpretation Warnings**
```
Do not over-interpret absolute magnitudes as detector-ready predictions...
```
Critical warnings about what NOT to conclude from the results.

## Common Questions

### "Can I run these toys myself?"

Yes! The Python implementations and JSON outputs are in the `toys/` folder:
- `py.zip` — All 90 source files
- `json.zip` — Pre-computed results
- `logs.zip` — Execution logs

See [toys/COMMANDS.md](../../toys/COMMANDS.md) for execution instructions.

### "What do I need to understand these?"

**Minimum background:**
- Graduate-level GR (know the Einstein equations, geodesics, Schwarzschild solution)
- Basic Python programming (if running code)
- JSON format (for reading outputs)

**Helpful but not required:**
- Numerical methods
- Quantum field theory (for Phases X-XI)
- Holography/AdS-CFT (for Phase XII)

### "Which toys are most important?"

**Foundational (everyone should know):**
- Toy 001 (Schwarzschild baseline)
- Toy 005 (Rindler horizons)
- Toy 007 (Eddington-Finkelstein)
- Toy 012 (Kerr spacetime)

**Conceptually deep:**
- Toy 066 (Unruh detector)
- Toy 074 (Quantum observer superposition)
- Toy 081 (Positive mass theorem boundary)

**Pedagogically valuable:**
- Toy 002 (Newtonian vs GR)
- Toy 010 (Photon sphere & ISCO)
- Toy 029 (Kruskal extension)

### "What if I find an error?"

These descriptions were generated by ChatGPT from source code and reviewed by Claude. While comprehensive, errors are possible.

If you find issues:
1. Check the source code in `toys/py.zip`
2. Compare with JSON output in `toys/json.zip`
3. Cross-reference with established GR literature
4. Report via GitHub issues

## Key Concepts to Remember

### 1. **Coordinate Artifacts ≠ Physical Effects**
Many things that "blow up" in GR are coordinate choices, not physics. Toys 001, 005, 007-009 emphasize this.

### 2. **Observer-Dependence is Real**
Many quantities in GR depend on who's measuring. This isn't a bug, it's a feature. See Phase V and XI.

### 3. **Energy is Ambiguous**
There's no unique gravitational energy in GR. Toy 006, 046, 065 demonstrate this explicitly.

### 4. **Horizons ≠ Singularities**
Event horizons are coordinate artifacts where curvature is finite. Singularities are where curvature diverges. Never confuse them.

### 5. **Quantum Makes Everything Worse**
All classical ambiguities become worse when quantum effects are included. Phases X-XI show this systematically.

## Next Steps

1. **Pick your learning path** (sequential or topic-based)
2. **Read 2-3 toy descriptions** to get the rhythm
3. **Look at actual JSON outputs** in `toys/json.zip` to see the data
4. **Try running a toy** yourself (optional)
5. **Cross-reference** with GR textbooks you know
