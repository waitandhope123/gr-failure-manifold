### Toy 80 — Black Hole Complementarity Violation (Firewall Proxy)
- Failure Trigger: observer + state
- Failure Mode: observer_disagreement
- Sharpness: sharp
- Repairable: no
- **Observed Results**:
  - Static observers see diverging near-horizon energy density
  - Infalling observers expect vacuum

*Kills “Local physics is observer-independent.”*

## End State

At Toy 70:

- Every classical failure trigger is sampled
- Every classical failure mode is demonstrated
- Failures are sharp, thick, and contextual
- Classical GR is mapped as an **effective theory with a failure manifold**
- The failure manifold is not eliminable by:
  - saturating geometric data (Toy 65)
  - fixing the observer (Toy 66)
  - fixing the quantum state (Toy 67)
  - invoking semiclassical backreaction (Toy 68)
  - appealing to entropy–area arguments (Toy 69)
  - reconstructing from local data (Toy 70)

At Toy 80:

- Observer-independence itself fails
- Causal structure becomes non-unique
- Proper time becomes branch-dependent
- Time becomes relational and state-dependent
- Local physics becomes observer-conditional
- No unique notion of geometry, causality, or time survives quantization of observers

The failure manifold **does not close** under:
- quantum observers (Toys 74, 75)
- entanglement-first reconstruction (Toy 76)
- superposed causal sources (Toy 77)
- relational time emergence (Toy 78)
- thermodynamic time definitions (Toy 79)
- black hole complementarity (Toy 80)

**This lab does not argue against General Relativity.  
It shows precisely where it becomes an effective description —  
and where the notion of spacetime itself ceases to be well-defined.**
