# Toys Directory

This directory contains the executed diagnostic outputs for the GR Failure Manifold.

## Contents

- **TOYS.md**  
  Canonical index of all toys, their classification, and observed results.
  This mirrors the structure described in the root README.

- **Toys.zip**  
  Archive containing all executed toy JSON files.
  Each JSON encodes parameters, observables, and detected failure signals
  for a single toy.

Toy numbering matches the index exactly.
Toy 50 is intentionally absent (not executed).

## Why a ZIP?

The ZIP is provided to keep the repository lightweight while preserving
machine-readable execution data. The project is diagnostic, not a live
simulation framework.
