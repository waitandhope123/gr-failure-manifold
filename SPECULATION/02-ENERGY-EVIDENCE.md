# Energy Evidence: Why Energy Appears Emergent

## The Central Problem

**In GR, energy is:**
- Non-unique (multiple definitions)
- Non-conserved (globally)
- Observer-dependent
- Underdetermined by geometry

**This is radically different from every other fundamental theory.**

---

## The Evidence Trail

### 1. Multiple Inequivalent Definitions (Toy 6)

**Test:** Schwarzschild spacetime, compute quasilocal mass using different standard prescriptions.

**Result:**
- Different definitions give different answers
- No invariant energy density
- Boundary choice alters energy attribution

**What this means:**

In EM or QM, energy is **unique**. Given the field configuration, there's one energy.

In GR, "energy" means **"which definition are you using?"**

| Theory | Energy Definition | Unique? |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| EM | T^00 (stress tensor) | ✓ Yes |
| QM | ⟨H⟩ (Hamiltonian) | ✓ Yes |
| Thermodynamics | U = Q + W | ✓ Yes |
| **GR** | ADM? Komar? Brown-York? | **✗ No** |

**Implication:** Energy in GR is not a **fundamental observable**, but a **choice of coarse-graining procedure**.

---

### 2. No Canonical Choice (Toy 46)

**Test:** Asymptotically de Sitter spacetime. Attempt to define conserved energy.

**Result:**
- ADM energy: Undefined (not asymptotically flat)
- No conserved charge from Killing vector (spatial translations don't exist)
- Multiple ad-hoc proposals, none canonical

**What this means:**

Even in a simple, highly symmetric spacetime (dS), there's **no agreed-upon energy**.

**Analogy:**

Imagine if electromagnetism had no unique definition of charge in a constant magnetic field. That would suggest charge isn't fundamental to EM.

Similarly: GR has no unique energy in dS → energy isn't fundamental to GR.

---

### 3. Global Conservation Fails (Toys 51, 55)

**Toy 51: FLRW cosmology (expanding universe)**

**Test:** Does total energy of matter + gravitational field remain constant?

**Result:**
- Matter energy density: ρ ∝ a^(-3) (dilutes as space expands)
- Gravitational potential energy: Ambiguous (no unique definition)
- Total energy: **Not conserved** or **undefined**

**Toy 55: Gravitational waves**

**Test:** Do gravitational waves carry energy?

**Result:**
- Locally: No unique stress-energy for gravitational field
- Globally: Energy flux can be defined (asymptotically)
- But: Energy is **not a local observable**

**What this means:**

Energy conservation is **approximate** and **observer-dependent**, not exact.

| Theory | Energy Conservation | Status |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| EM | ∂_μ T^μν = 0 | Exact, local |
| QM | d⟨H⟩/dt = 0 | Exact (closed system) |
| GR | ∇_μ T^μν = 0 | Covariant, but T includes only matter |
| **GR (total)** | **No conserved total energy** | **Undefined/approximate** |

**Implication:** Energy behaves like an **emergent thermodynamic quantity** (conserved only in idealized limits), not a fundamental conserved charge.

### 4. Same Geometry, Different Energy (Toy 61)

**Test:** Schwarzschild black hole in different quantum states (vacuum choices).

**Result:**
- Geometry: Identical (same g_μν)
- Quantum state: Boulware vs Hartle-Hawking vs Unruh
- Stress-energy: **Different for each state**

**What this means:**

Geometry **does not uniquely determine energy**.

In a fundamental theory:
- Specify fundamental variables → all observables determined
- Example: Specify |ψ⟩ in QM → all expectations determined

In GR:
- Specify g_μν → energy **NOT** determined
- Also need: quantum state

**This suggests geometry is not fundamental.**

---

### 5. Non-Uniqueness on Identical Vacuum Geometry (Toy 65)

**Test:** Schwarzschild vacuum (Ricci scalar = 0 everywhere). Compute energy using:
1. Misner-Sharp mass
2. Brown-York surface energy

**Result:**

| Radius | Misner-Sharp M | Brown-York E | Difference |
|--------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| r = 6M | 1.00 | 0.10 | 10× |
| r = 3M | 1.00 | 0.27 | 3.7× |
| r = 2.1M | 1.00 | 0.64 | 1.6× |

**Key point:** 
- Same spacetime
- Same Ricci scalar (zero)
- **Different "energies"**
- Both definitions are "standard"
- **No experiment can say which is "the" energy**

**What this means:**

Even in the **simplest vacuum case** (Schwarzschild), energy is **not unique**.

**Analogy:**

Imagine asking "What's the temperature of this gas?" and getting different answers depending on whether you use kinetic theory vs thermodynamic definition—and both are "correct" by their own standards.

That would suggest temperature is **not a fundamental property** but an **emergent/contextual one**.

**Same for energy in GR.**

### 6. QFT-GR Incompatibility: The 10^123 Problem (Toy 72)

**Test:** Compare vacuum energy density from:
1. QFT calculation (sum over zero-point energies)
2. Cosmological constant observation

**Result:**

```
QFT prediction:  ρ_vac ~ M_Planck^4 ~ 10^76 GeV^4
GR observation:  ρ_Λ ~ 10^-47 GeV^4
Discrepancy:     10^123  (worst prediction in physics history)
```

**What this means:**

This is not an "observer-dependence" issue or "contextual definition" issue.

This is a **sharp numerical contradiction** between two established theories.

**Why this points to emergence:**

Both QFT and GR treat energy as **fundamental input**:
- QFT: Sum zero-point energies → ρ_vac
- GR: Measure ρ_Λ from expansion rate

If energy were fundamental, both should agree (or at least be reconcilable).

The 10^123 mismatch suggests:
1. QFT's calculation assumes wrong fundamental DOFs
2. GR's Λ is not "vacuum energy" but something else
3. **Both theories are effective**, with energy emergent from deeper substrate

**Connection to Interpretation A2:**

If both spacetime (GR) and quantum fields (QFT) emerge from pre-geometric quantum information:
- QFT's "vacuum energy" is an artifact of field-theoretic description
- GR's "cosmological constant" is an effective parameter
- The fine-tuning problem dissolves: Λ_eff emerges from coarse-graining, not fundamental calculation

---

### 7. No Sharp Planck-Scale Cutoff (Toy 50)

**Test:** Near-horizon quantum corrections in Schwarzschild spacetime at r ≈ 2M.

**Question:** Is there a sharp Planck-length boundary where GR definitively "breaks"?

**Result:**

```
Near-horizon region (r slightly above 2M):
- Kretschmann scalar: K ~ M^-2 (classical)
- Quantum correction scale: ℓ_Planck^2 / r^2
- Even at r = 2.001 M:
  - Classical curvature dominates
  - Quantum corrections ~ 10^-60 (suppressed by (M_BH/M_Planck)^2)
  - No sharp transition to "quantum regime"
```

**What this means:**

There is **no sharp Planck-scale boundary** where energy becomes "well-defined" or GR definitively fails.

Instead:
- Quantum corrections are **smooth** and **suppressed** (for astrophysical black holes)
- Classical GR remains accurate even near horizon
- The "Planck regime" is not a fixed place, but a **parametric ratio**: (M_BH/M_Planck)

**Implication:**

Energy problems in GR are not "solved at Planck scale."

They persist **across all scales**, indicating a **systematic effective theory issue**, not a UV cutoff problem.

**Connection to Toy 82 (Swampland Distance Conjecture):**

Toy 82 shows EFT breakdown is **smooth and parameter-dependent**, not a universal Planck cutoff.

Toy 50 shows the same pattern: No sharp scale where "quantum gravity takes over."

**This supports emergence:** GR's energy ambiguity is not a "high-energy problem" to be resolved by quantum gravity corrections. It's a **feature of coarse-grained effective description** across all scales.

## The Pattern: Energy as Emergent Statistical Property

### Summary of Evidence

| Evidence | Toy(s) | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Multiple definitions | 6 | Energy is not unique |
| No canonical choice | 46 | Energy depends on boundary conditions |
| Global conservation fails | 51, 55 | Energy not exactly conserved |
| Geometry underdetermines energy | 61, 67 | Energy requires quantum state |
| Non-unique in vacuum | 65 | Energy ambiguous even in simplest case |
| QFT-GR mismatch | 72 | Both theories treat energy incorrectly |
| No sharp Planck boundary | 50 | Energy problems persist across scales |

**Total: 9 independent toys demonstrating energy non-fundamentality**

### What Emergent Energy Looks Like

**Compare to temperature:**

| Property | Temperature | Energy in GR |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Multiple definitions | Kinetic, thermodynamic, statistical | ADM, Komar, Brown-York |
| Fundamentally unique? | No (emergent from microstate) | No (depends on method) |
| Conserved? | No (can exchange heat) | No (globally) |
| Determined by fundamental variables? | No (many microstates → same T) | No (same g_μν → different E) |
| Well-defined at all scales? | No (breaks down for small N) | No (breaks down at boundaries) |

**Temperature is emergent from statistical mechanics.**

**Energy in GR appears emergent in the same way.**

---

### What This Means for Fundamental Physics

**If energy is emergent:**

1. **Einstein field equations are effective:** G_μν = 8πG T_μν is not fundamental, but a **coarse-grained relation** (like ∂S/∂U = 1/T in thermodynamics).

2. **Conservation is approximate:** ∇_μ T^μν = 0 is valid only in appropriate limits (like energy conservation in thermodynamics holds only for closed systems).

3. **Quantum gravity must explain:** How does energy emerge from pre-geometric quantum information? (Like how temperature emerges from molecular motion in statistical mechanics.)

4. **The 10^123 problem dissolves:** If both QFT and GR are effective, their "energy" quantities need not match—they're artifacts of different coarse-graining schemes.

---

## Why This Points to Interpretation A2

**Interpretation A1 (fields on spacetime) predicts:**
- Quantum fields are fundamental
- Spacetime is fixed background
- Energy is well-defined in QFT

**But:**
- Toy 72: QFT predicts wrong vacuum energy (10^123 error)
- Toy 50: No sharp scale where "QFT takes over"
- Doesn't resolve energy non-uniqueness (still depends on boundaries)

**Interpretation A2 (pre-geometric quantum info) predicts:**
- Neither fields nor spacetime fundamental
- Both emerge from quantum information substrate
- Energy emerges during coarse-graining

**Explains:**
- ✓ Energy non-uniqueness (depends on coarse-graining choice)
- ✓ Global non-conservation (emergent quantities need not conserve exactly)
- ✓ QFT-GR mismatch (both are effective approximations)
- ✓ Geometry underdetermination (energy depends on how you partition fundamental DOFs)
- ✓ No sharp boundary (emergence is smooth, not sudden)

## The Analogy to Thermodynamics

### Historical Parallel

**19th century:**
- Temperature, pressure, entropy seemed fundamental
- Multiple definitions (thermodynamic vs kinetic)
- Conservation seemed approximate
- Small-scale behavior unclear

**Resolution (statistical mechanics):**
- These quantities are **emergent statistical properties**
- Fundamental level: molecular motion
- Emergent level: thermodynamic variables
- Connection: coarse-graining (averaging over microstates)

**21st century:**
- Energy, spacetime, causality seem fundamental  
- Multiple definitions (ADM vs Komar vs Brown-York)
- Conservation seems approximate
- Planck-scale behavior unclear

**Proposed resolution (quantum information):**
- These quantities are **emergent informational properties**
- Fundamental level: pre-geometric quantum information
- Emergent level: spacetime + fields
- Connection: coarse-graining (tracing over entanglement)

---

## Confidence Assessment

**Claim:** Energy in GR is emergent, not fundamental.

**Evidence strength:**
- Number of independent toys: 9
- Consistency across different regimes: High (cosmology, black holes, vacuum, quantum)
- Theoretical coherence: High (matches other emergent quantities)
- Experimental confirmation: Medium (indirect—no experiment can pick unique energy)

**Confidence: ~85%**

**Why not higher:**
- No explicit microscopic theory yet showing how energy emerges
- Alternative explanations possible (though increasingly strained)

**Why not lower:**
- 9 independent failure modes
- Systematic pattern across scales
- Strong analogy to other emergent quantities (temperature, entropy)
- 10^123 vacuum energy problem decisive

---

## What Would Change Our Mind

**To conclude energy is fundamental, we'd need:**

1. **Unique definition discovered**
   - All current definitions shown equivalent
   - Experiment prefers one definition
   - Would suggest fundamental conserved quantity

2. **Toy 65 resolved**
   - Misner-Sharp and Brown-York reconciled
   - Vacuum energy ambiguity eliminated
   - Would suggest energy is intrinsic to geometry

3. **Toy 72 explained within current frameworks**
   - 10^123 problem resolved without new physics
   - QFT and GR reconciled
   - Would suggest both theories are more fundamental than we think

4. **Sharp Planck boundary found (contra Toy 50)**
   - Clean cutoff at fixed scale
   - Quantum gravity "takes over" suddenly
   - Would suggest fundamental UV completion, not emergence

**None of these seem likely given current evidence.**

---

## The Bottom Line

**Energy in GR behaves like temperature in thermodynamics:**
- Multiple definitions ✓
- Not uniquely determined by "fundamental" variables ✓
- Approximately conserved ✓
- Ill-defined at boundaries ✓
- Catastrophic mismatch with microscopic theory ✓
- No sharp scale of validity ✓

**This strongly suggests energy is an emergent statistical property, not a fundamental conserved charge.**

**And if energy is emergent, what coarse-graining is producing it?**

**Answer: Coarse-graining of pre-geometric quantum information into effective spacetime description.**

*Energy is real. But it's real the way temperature is real: as a macroscopic emergent property, not a microscopic fundamental one.*
